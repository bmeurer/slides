    - Large amounts of foreign investment, highly dependent on trade relations
    - Financial services, manufacturing of integrated circuits and computers, oil refining
    - Unique culture from melting pot of immigrants with locals throughout history -> Singlish

- About the web
    - Local flavour is appreciated when done well, Bus Uncle chatbot highly popular
    - We just did a Super Silly Hackathon over the weekend, a very Singlish-filled event
    - Participants were a very diverse mix of ethnicities, nationalities and backgrounds, which is a reflection of Singaporeâ€™s developer community
    - Strong tech community, KopiJS, a LOT of meet-ups, Geek Bruch, Engineers.SG, organisers all generally know each other, resources for starting your own community groups
    - Meet-ups relatively easy to start and keep going because of good public infrastructure
    - Public wifi widely available, surprisingly decent, once dialled-in to Talk.CSS from the airport before flying
    - Community leaders are accessible and easy to meet up with
    - Companies generally supportive of hosting meet-ups, public infrastructure conducive

- Crowd-sourced opinions
    - Lots of companies and startups still using ASP.NET webforms, .NET frameworks etc
    - Internet access generally good for the price
    - Recent demand for JS stacks (1-2 years behind the cutting edge)
    - Some people consider mobile data size limited, either going for reliability versus more data

- Open-source and entrepreneurship
    - A lot of Open Data initiatives, Chee Aun built a lot of apps
    - Entrepreneurship encouraged but few businesses have return on investment (56.8% startups struggling to scale and generate employment)
    - Government keen on building up Fintech and AI, though given the small population, expertise is limited

- Additional notes on censorship
    - IMDA (Infocomm Media Development Authority) blocks about 100 websites
    - According to Freedom House, Singapore is slightly better than Indonesia, but worse off than the Philippines
    - Limits on access are minimal but mostly limits on content, especially political content, anything seen to incite unrest
