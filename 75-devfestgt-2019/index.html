              <p>The World Wide Web turned 30 years old this year back in March. Maybe this is considered ancient for some of you, but if you think about it, this technology that almost all of us use everyday, is really quite young.</p>
              <p>If we think about other mediums for transmitting knowledge and information, print has had thousands of years to develop. The telephone, from its mechanical predecessors till today, also had hundreds of years to evolve.</p>
              <p>30 years really is not a long time at all. And when the web launched, this was what it looked like. Text. Lines and lines of text.</p>

              <p>So when the web started out, ðŸ‘¾ layout was non-existent. You could format your text with spaces, line breaks and indents, sure. But having a designed visual layout on your web page? Nope.</p>
              <p>The HTML2 specification which was released in 1994 introduced ðŸ‘¾ the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag and although its intended use was for tabular data, that didn't stop people from using it to build all sorts of cool and funky layouts. Sure, some of the techniques involved slicing up an image into multiple parts or whatever, but it worked. Sort of.</p>
              <p>Then CSS came along in 1996, and with it came ðŸ‘¾ floats. And developers learned a new way to layout elements on their page. But floats weren't easy to deal with. Columns were uneven heights, things got displaced and didn't line up, you had to clear stuff.</p>
              <p>And because it was so hard and unwieldy, ðŸ‘¾ some people decided to build out pre-written code, AKA a framework, and let everyone else apply these pre-written styles with classes. This approach was really popular and we hit an age where a lot of websites had very similar layouts.</p>

              <p>But CSS is an evolving technology. Yes, it started out in 1996 as a long monolithic document, and at the time, browser vendors treated the implementation of CSS a bit like how Malaysians treat traffic laws. We take them as suggestions rather than rules.</p>
              <p>The CSS Working Group was created in 1997 to tackle issues which were not addressed in the first version of CSS and they have been working on improving and evolving CSS ever since.</p>
              <p>By 2000, CSS had been broken up into modules to clarify the relationships between different parts of the specification, and make it easier to test, update and maintain the specification as a whole.</p>
              <p>The 2018 CSS Snapshot released in January this year now consists of 99 modules, many of which are being actively worked on.</p>

              <p>In CSS2, we had 4 layout modes that each worked better for different use-cases. We had block layout, which was meant for laying out boxes on the page. ðŸ‘¾ We had inline layout, meant for laying out text.</p>
              <p>ðŸ‘¾ Then we had table layouts that worked best for laying out 2D data in a tabular format. ðŸ‘¾ And positioned layout, which was like an escape hatch, that let us position elements without regard to other elements on the page.</p>
              <p>But in 2009, ðŸ‘¾ the flex layout model was proposed, and it was the first layout model designed specifically for building dynamic layouts on the web. It introduced new and powerful methods for distributing space and aligning content in a way that better suited the dynamic nature of the web.</p>

              <p>Some people have asked me, so why do we need Grid then, when we already have Flexbox? If Flexbox is really as great as I say it is. I also get the question: is Grid supposed to replace Flexbox?</p>
              <p>ðŸ‘¾ Wrong questions, my friends. Wrong questions. Why? Because these 2 layout techniques are not competing against each other. They are meant to be complementary.</p>
