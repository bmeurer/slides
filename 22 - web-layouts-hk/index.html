          <aside class="notes">
            <p>But we're not here to talk about me. We're here to talk about the web. And doing layout on the web. The digital age started around the 1940s when the first electronic computers came about. Screens were introduced as an output device in the 1950s.</p>
            <p>Before this, we've always used physical media as a means of visual communication, from writing on all kinds of surfaces, to creating art, paintings and sculptures, or even physical expression through dance and performance.</p>
            <p>But an electronic display is a proxy medium. Whatever we see displayed on a screen comes from data encoded as electronic signals. The heart of electronic displays is light. It is transient. We cannot touch light.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Now, when it comes to the web, HTML was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And the first graphical web browsers were released around 1992. CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 and was developed into a W3C recommendation by 1996. The reason I'm throwing all these dates at you is to remind you that digital is less than a hundred years old. The web isn't even 30 yet, so it's really a very young medium. The likes of which we've never seen before.</aside>

            <p>Back in my day, every angsty teenager had their own blog where they would express their innermost thoughts and feelings in a lot more than 140 characters.</p>
            <p>The web had started to take off and not everybody wanted to spend a lot of time building their own websites from scratch. So a lot of these blogs were hosted on blogging platforms, like Blogspot. LiveJournal was a thing back then too. You could theme your blogs, and some people did, but most people picked from a pool of available options.</p>
            <p>This was around the time when screen sizes started to get bigger than 640 pixels. But we can't have extra space lying around, right? That space must be filled! So we started to have sidebars. Sidebars with links to other blogs or sites, or contact information, if you were entrepreneurial you could chuck an ad or 2 in there.</p>

            <p>Now in the mid-2000s this was real hot. Because screen sizes had continued to grow, and so instead of 1 sidebar, why not have 2? But this layout wasn't easy to achieve, I mean, you could still use HTML tables, but come on, it was the 2000s. Cutting edge CSS with floats was the way to go.</p>
            <p>Except that it wasn't really. You see, floats weren't meant to used for layouts either. Like using HTML tables for layout, floats were also a hack, but they were all we had at the time to achieve the layouts we wanted. To fully grasp float-based layouts, you also needed to know about clearfixing, about negative margins, have good arithmetic skills to calculate gaps. No, not easy at all.</p>

            <p>By this time, a lot of people just threw their hands up in surrender and outsourced the pain to CSS frameworks instead. And it's so understandable. Especially if they are not familiar with CSS, or they are short of time, or they just don't like CSS in general.</p>
            <p>But frameworks are quite prescriptive, and that's how we end up with a lot of websites that utilise very similar layouts. The flavour of the day at the moment is this panel style, you know, with content sectioned up in panes.</p>

            <p>CSS has been around for about 20 years now, and the last I checked, there were 501 distinct properties. And you don't have to know every single one of them, I'm just pointing out that we can achieve a lot more with CSS than ever before.</p>
            <p>So these are some of the CSS properties I find relevant for web layouts, too many for me to cover in half an hour. CSS is an integral part of web layout, and it's really about combining different properties to create designs that are truly web.</p>

            <p>They both operate on what I call a container-child relationship, in that the <code>display</code> property is applied to a parent container that affects the layout of all the children in that container.</p>

          <h2>Flexbox</h2>
          <p>Provides “simple and powerful tools for distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps and complex web pages often need”</p>
          <aside class="notes">The idea of Flexbox was discussed before 2008, with the first working draft of the specification published in 2009. The implementation of Flexbox was rather messy. The trouble was that a number of developers used this yet-to-be-finalised feature in production, so everyone was in a bind when it came to updating the implementation.</aside>

Support is really quite good now, but even so, I think we haven't pushed it to its maximum potential yet. I don't deny that Flexbox is not as straight-forward as <code>color</code> or <code>text-decoration</code>, but that's because it can do a lot more than those properties.</aside>

}</style></div>
          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The most basic use-case for Flexbox is centring stuff. When I first learnt Flexbox, I hadn't fully grasped box alignment yet. I used to centre items by applying <code>align-items: center</code> and <code>justify-content: center</code> to the parent container because all the blog posts said so.</p>
            <p>This technique works just fine, but I only found out much later that if there's only 1 flex child, <code>margin: auto;</code> does the same thing.</p>
            <p>When you have more than 1 item, an understanding of box alignment makes things much easier. Say we want to centre both these children. Setting <code>justify-content: center</code> aligns them along the inline-axis, while setting <code>align-items: center</code> aligns them along the block-axis. Flexbox by default lays out all its children in one line without wrapping, so change that to <code>wrap</code>. Wrap only kicks in when the content is longer than the container, so make the width of one of the children <code>100%</code>.</p>
            <p>There's a difference between <code>align-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, where content controls alignment of the box's content within its content box, and items specifies the behaviour for each individual child.</p>

              <td><code>flex: &lt;positive-number&gt;</code></td>
              <td><code>flex: &lt;positive-number&gt; 1 0</code>, can grow and shrink, extent of growth depends on flex factor</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>For flex children, the key property is <code>flex</code>. It is strongly recommended that we use the <code>flex</code> shorthand rather than each of the individual long-hand properties. First value for amount of growth, second value for amount of shrinkage and last value being the starting width before free space is distributed.</p>
            <p>Anyhoo, <code>flex</code> comes with some handy keyword values for commonly-desired effects, as shown in this table. If we don't set the flex value on a flex child, it's default behaviour is cannot grow, will shrink.</p>

            <p>A common issue I hear is that it's difficult to create a grid system with Flexbox. The thing about Flexbox is, even though you can make a grid system with it, it isn't the best idea to do so.</p>
            <p>Flexbox is suited for laying out items in a single dimension. Where there isn't a relationship between the rows and columns. Think of it more like a daisy chain of flex children.</p>
            <p>Here, I have a list of images. Once I apply <code>display: flex</code>, all the items are shrunk and laid out in a single row. If I turn on wrap, they all revert to their original size because now there is no limit to how much space they need to take up, if there is no space, the image will just drop down to the next row.</p>
            <p>I'll turn on the border so you can see how each flex child behaves. Now instead of the initial behaviour of can shrink no grow, I'll change it to can grow no shrink and make the images take up the width of the child container. Now, there are a lot of options we can play with in terms of designing the whole layout.</p>
            <p>I can do an <code>align-items: center</code> and create this jagged look, which is kinda interesting. Sometimes I find neat grids a bit monotonous. But if we want neat, we can also standardise the height of the flex children. Yeah, this makes the aspect ratio screwed up, so we compromise by cropping off the taller images with the <code>object-fit</code> property.</p>

            <p>I can also change the direction of the layout by setting <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> and giving the container a defined height. Now I've got this horizontal scroll going on.</p>
            <p>Again, we can go with the funky, jagged look by adjusting the flex children's alignment. Now that the flex direction has changed, the block and inline axes has also changed. <code>justify-content</code> shifts along the vertical axis, while <code>align-items</code> shifts along the horizontal axis.</p>
            <p>Or we could go neat, and do the cropping thing again. Remove the alignment code, make the flex children totally flexible and images fill up their containers' heights. <code>calc()</code> is an indispensable function I use when creating layouts. Here, <code>calc()</code> let's me account for the margins of each image with respect to their container heights. I can fix the widths of the images to get something like this.</p>
            <p>And these layouts are a demonstration of what Flexbox can do out-of-the-box. They are not hacks. These are native options that we have when it comes to designing our layouts.</p>

          <p>Place items in the grid.</p>
          <aside class="notes">So this is the basic premise of how grid works. You define the grid, then place items in it either by yourself, or let the browser do it for you. Now, there are a myriad of options for both these actions, which is what makes grid so powerful, and why some people may find it intimidating at first. Let's see how Grid works when we let the browser do the placement.</aside>

          <h2>Fixed CSS grid</h2>

            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">With Grid, we can do all the things we're used to doing, except more easily. Like this fixed grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function really comes in handy when your columns or rows follow a similar pattern. In this case, I'm telling the browser to give me five 10em wide columns. It's fixed, so no size changes here.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Fluid CSS grid</h2>

            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Grid also introduces the <code>fr</code> unit, which represents a fraction of the free space in the grid container. In this example, I'm telling the browser I want each of my five columns to take up equal proportions of free space available. And so, they shrink and grow together with container.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Responsive CSS grid</h2>
          <pre><code class="css" style="font-size: 90%;">.container {
  display: grid;

}</code></pre>

          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Now this is something new we've never been able to do before. The <code>minmax()</code> function lets me tell the browser that I want to cap the shrink at 10ems but if there's extra space, grow all my columns equally. Because of the cap, once there isn't enough space to fit 5 columns, the number of columns will decrease until everything fits. Didn't need a single media query for that.</aside>

            <p>We can also define exactly where we want our grid items to go. <code>grid-row</code> and <code>grid-column</code> are the short-hands used to set an item's grid position.</p>
            <p>By default, a grid item will occupy one grid cell, but we can use the <code>span</code> keyword to define how many grid tracks an item should take up. Grid lines are referred to using their numerical index, starting from 1.</p>

            <p>In the pre-Grid era, every HTML element had to be rendered one after another. To achieve some semblance of vertical white-space, we used things like spacer gifs, remember those? Or other creative hacks.</p>
            <p>But now, we can place items wherever we want on the Grid we defined. Think of it like placing pieces on a chessboard, using the <code>grid-row</code> and <code>grid-column</code> properties on the grid item.</p>
            <p>We can also name areas of the grid with the <code>grid-template-areas</code> property, which I find great for white-space because you can create empty cells, using the dot notation.</p>
            <p>Placement then involves telling the grid item which area it needs to go into, like how I'm going to shift the sixth shoe into grid area “f”.</p>

            <p>With 3D transforms, we are operating with one more axis, which is the z-axis, for depth. So there are some additional properties like <code>backface-visibility</code> and <code>perspective</code>, for example. The <code>perspective</code> property controls how far an element appears to recede into the horizon. The smaller the value, the more dramatic the 3D effect is.</p>
            <p>So if I change the value of perspective here to something smaller, you can see that the horizon recedes much further away.</p>

          <h2>Writing-mode</h2>
          <p>Defines CSS features to support for various international writing modes</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A large swathe of the world use writing systems that flow left-to-right, from top-to-bottom, languages like English, French, German etc. But writing systems go in all directions. East Asian languages like Chinese and Japanese can be written vertically or horizontally. Arabic and Hebrew scripts are written from right-to-left.</p>
            <p>That's why we have the writing-mode property. Because it's the WORLD wide web. But we're all creative people, right? So, yes, the primary use of writing-modes is to correctly present the various writing systems on the web. However, writing mode can also be used for art direction.</p>

We can apply a rotate to make the text face the opposite direction as well, like the green example. So how can we use this in the context of a Latin-based writing system?</aside>

          <img class="plain" data-src="img/wm-eg.jpg">
          <aside class="notes">One idea is for headers. It might not be the best idea to layout long chunks of text vertically because that just makes it hard to read. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.</aside>

          <img class="plain" data-src="img/wm-eg2.jpg">
          <aside class="notes">Other subtle uses could be things like tags for blog posts, where the information is not critical to the main content, so laying it out vertically doesn't adversely affect the reading experience.</aside>

          <video controls loop>

            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, 
            but don't worry, you can <a href="videos/menu.mp4">download it</a>
            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Also, depending on the number of links in your navigation menu, perhaps a vertical layout on a narrow screen could be a design option worth considering. Today's CSS really gives us a lot more creative choices as compared to when responsive design first was a thing back in 2010.</aside>

          <h2>Feature Queries</h2>
          <p class="ciu_embed" data-feature="css-featurequeries" data-periods="future_1,current,past_1,past_2">
            <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries"><img class="plain" data-src="img/caniuse-feature-queries.jpg"></a>
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">The last thing, and possibly the most important thing I want to cover is feature queries. Feature queries are like Modernizr, except native to CSS. And support for it is really good, with coverage in over 90% of browsers, including Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <pre><code class="css">.selector {
  /* Styles that are supported in old browsers */
}

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And this is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored.</p>
            <p>This means we start off with the basic layout that works everywhere. It could be a single column, largely browser default UI elements, that sort of thing. Then we layer on styles based on the features we want to use.</p>
            <p>By organising our code in this manner, the browsers that do not support feature queries or the specified property still get styled, while those that do get a different look. We're making use of the ‘C’ in CSS.</p>

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The layout on the left is what IE11 users will see, the one in the middle is what Firefox users will see, because Firefox doesn't support CSS shapes yet, but once it does, it will then look like the layout on the right, which is what Chrome users see now.</p>
            <p>And yes, this approach does require a level of familiarity with CSS, but it's not rocket science. It boils down to experience, and the willingness to embrace CSS for what it is.</p>
