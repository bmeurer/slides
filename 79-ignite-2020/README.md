# Talk.CSS, 4 years and counting

*For Microsoft Ignite Singapore 2020 (Humans of IT). This is sort of a transcript for the talk.*

Hello everyone! So today I'll be sharing about a small community group that I've been heavily involved in for more than 4 years. This group is part of the much larger Singapore tech community but given how small Singapore is (like literally), let's just say, most of us know each other and overlap communities anyway.

As you can see from the title slide, I'm going to be talking about Talk.CSS. Talk is a common English word. I checked the dictionary and it means “speak in order to give information or express ideas or feelings; converse or communicate by spoken words”. But CSS is not a common English word.

What is CSS? For the benefit of anyone who is not familiar with web development, CSS is an acronym for 🌬 Cascading Stylesheets. Stylesheets are used to 🌬 describe the presentation of a web page by telling the browser how elements on the page ought to be styled and laid out.

It is a stylesheet language, 🌬 which has its own syntax and rules. As with any community made up of humans, everyone has their own opinion, and that's okay, it's a normal human thing. But naturally, there are also people who have “Opinions”, with a capital O. And some of them have such Opinions about CSS.

There is a sizeable portion of developers out there who regard CSS as inferior, a necessary evil that is not “real programming”, whatever that definition is. 🌬 The thing about CSS is it FEELS easy at first glance. It's just a bunch of rules, how hard can it be? So it's not surprising that people who jump in expecting things to work a certain way end up angry at CSS when their expectations are not met.

If the world of programming was like high school, CSS would be probably be the nerdy artsy kid who gets bullied a lot, but is oh-so-talented at drawing and stuff. Okay, maybe that was a bad analogy. 🌬 But that was just a long-winded way to explain that CSS is not exactly winning any popularity contests at large.

Now, let's talk about the Singapore tech community. My first proper web development job was back in 2013 with a small Drupal agency that somehow thought it was a good idea to hire someone who had built all of 2 Drupal websites in their entire life. I'm forever grateful for that. But anyway, given we were a Drupal shop, our bosses were sort of involved with the Drupal meetup group.

Drupal is a content-management framework written in PHP, so the other meetup group I was aware of back then was the PHP user group. And that's how I got to know Michael Cheng, who I was endearingly introduced to as the “Godfather of PHP”. I have since kept calling him 师父, which translates to “master” or “skillful person”.

Personally, I'm a front-end developer, which means I mostly attended meetup groups on web-related technologies. But I also liked hardware and was happy to find out about the maker scene in Singapore as well. Singapore is not a big country.

It is so small that I often find out many of my primary school friends and my JC friends end up knowing each other from University. Back then, there were only 2 options so it's not that surprising. So you can imagine how easy it is for us to find out about other tech meetups whenever we attend one.

webuild.sg was a project by Sayanee Basu and Chinmay Pendharkar which curated a list of all the free public tech events and open source projects in Singapore. It ran from 2013 till 2018 when it merged in with Engineers.SG.

Engineers.SG is a local community initiative started by Michael to answer the question, where are all the engineers in Singapore? He joked that this was clearly a marketing problem, and started his one-man endeavour to record every tech meetup in Singapore he could attend. Because this was crazy, friends joined in to help and it soon became a volunteer group.

We also have things like KopiJS, started by Chee Aun, another local community leader, and Geek Brunch SG, which are really chill meetups where like-minded folks just hang out and don't even have to talk about tech, though we naturally just gravitate toward the subject. And there are so many more across the whole spectrum of tech.

I mention folks by name because at the end of the day, there is no community without individuals who put in time and effort to organise, plan and execute. And these folks, these amazing human beings whom I see as community leaders, have built up something special.

They have established a culture which is warm, inclusive and welcoming. They emphasised the values and ideals of sharing knowledge, of helping each other out and nurturing the local tech community into the vibrant scene that it is today.

👾👾👾

SingaporeCSS is merely a beneficiary of such a culture and community. I probably attended my first talk.js back in 2014. SingaporeJS is the local Javascript meetup group which started in 2013 and is still going strong. I also went to the PHP and Drupal meetups, the Ruby meetup for some reason, even though I know nuts about Ruby. They are all web-y, I suppose.

Given now that it is 2020, I doubt anyone even remembers their first encounter with me anymore. But back then, I'd attend meetups, maybe eat a slide of free pizza, listen to the talks, then leave. I almost never start a conversation but I don't mind having one. I recognise and remember faces fairly well though.

Eventually, when you show up at enough meetups, people start to know you and you start to know them as well. I gave my first talk ever in 2015 at talk.js because one of the organisers was a friend of mine, and needed to find speakers. I would soon learn once I became an organiser myself that this will always be THE problem we face.

And what did I talk about at the Javascript meetup? Nothing related to Javascript, that's what. I talked about a HTML element called the `<picture>` element. But there weren't any other frontend-focused meetups other than talk.js, so I guess it was tangentially related enough.

KopiJS, other than a physical meet-up where people chill out and la kopi (which translates to drink coffee), is also an online slack community. It is, until today, one of the slack channels that I'm permanently in, in contrast to the other 50 or so I've never opened since I joined. And one random mid-day on 26 October, 2015, this conversation happened.

2 hours later, we had a meetup group, a Facebook page and plans for the first ever CSS meetup in Singapore.

If you are new to the Singapore tech community, and are interested in starting a meetup of your own, I have good news for you. This is one of the easiest places in the world to start your own meetup, in my opinion. For the reasons I have mentioned previously.

As with any meetup, 🌬 the 2 critical components are speakers and a venue. The venue bit is pretty easy to settle. Take it from someone whose meetup had this stupid idea to have a different venue every time from day 1. When we started out, our sister meetup Talk.JS was regularly hosted at the Paypal offices. Things have changed since then, but still.

What you'd do is take a peek at where other people were hosting their meetups. If you noticed a venue you like, you'd ping the meetup organiser and ask them to put you in touch with their recent host. Most of the time, there's your venue. Sometimes you'd have to repeat this a couple times but generally things work out fine.

🌬 You also want to have some way to inform the local tech public about your exciting new meetup. For me, I had the benefit of having friends who ran meetups themselves so I would show up at theirs and mention we were happening at such-and-such place at such-an-such date. Meetup.com is a popular platform for Singapore tech meetups to handle RSVPs.

And as a web developer myself, of course we had to have our own website. But as a cheap-ass local Chinese person, I also refused to pay for anything if I could help it so our website was and is still hosted for free on GitHub without a custom domain.

🌬 In the words of famous poet, Lady Gaga, social media is the toilet of the internet, but still, it is a necessary evil. So we also have a Facebook presence and a Twitter presence, in addition to Meetup.com and our website.

If you manage to snag sponsors for your event, good on you. CSS doesn't attract enough attendees for most HR departments anyway, so we don't get them. 🌬 But because our venues are so awesome in Singapore, a lot of the time they will toss in a few pizzas. My crowd is special. Why? Because they don't eat. Like seriously. But I know some other meetups where food gets snapped up in 15 minutes.

🌬 Engineers.SG is one of the most amazing things in the world, truly. Because it is a platform that showcases the local tech scene and the community it is made up of. They have been recording SingaporeCSS since our first meetup, and even though a couple failed along the way, for the most part, we have video evidence of almost every meetup ever.

🌬 Finally, depending on the amount of effort you want to put in, the post meetup housekeeping matters can be either non-existent or like me, I update the website with recap and videos, plus send out a newsletter. All purely optional activities, so you do you.

👾👾👾

It's not all smooth sailing. Some of you who organise meetups yourselves may relate to this, but especially for Asians, I feel, 🌬 asking someone to speak is worse than asking them to go to the dentist. Furthermore, the fact that CSS is not the most popular thing around, it is doubly challenging.

I have no solution to this. Co-founder of SingaporeCSS, Chris, who has moved back to Australia end of 2018, and I used to always have a handful of talks in our back pocket, ready to invoke whenever we had a speaker drought. Which, if you peek at our archives, is fairly often. Oh well.

🌬 Attendance is also sketchy, because we are a free event, so everybody drops out for reasons. Maybe their cat sick, they kena support ticket at 5pm that day, they got hot date, you know, lots of unexpected things in life. Drop off rate is pretty high, so RSVP numbers should be taken with a big block of salt. Personally I like to make fun of this, like screenshot-ing the number off Meetup.com then annotating it with emojis of aeroplane, kite, pigeon. You'll only get it if you're local.

This has not happened to us very often, but 🌬 sometimes the venue with renege on us fairly close to the meetup date. We have not cancelled a meetup because of that before, but have had to scramble to find a new venue in short notice. I usually fall back to Hackerspace.

🌬 It is true that having recordings done by Engineers.SG is the best thing ever, but it is also true that sometimes recordings will fail. Because we are a cursed meetup! No, just joking. It doesn't happen too often but it's usually due to the fact we always rotate meetups and given the complexity of the setup, the AV equipment at the venue sometimes just doesn't jive.

🌬 And lastly, tired. I would be lying if I said I hadn't thought about wrapping the whole thing up. I never thought this would last for more than 4 years. Last year was particularly challenging because Chris left to go back to Melbourne, and I was travelling a lot. Organising a meetup is quite thankless and I felt bad asking other people to take over my shit while I was out gallivanting around conferences and stuff.

👾👾👾

Of course I cannot help myself, we must mention COVID. I mean, the reason this is now an online thing is because of the virus situation to begin with. This is not a good situation but there have been some silver linings. Let me explain.

I feel that the closeness of the tech community has shone through during this trying time, and meetup organisers have rallied and led by Engineers.SG, we have quickly pivoted to moving things online rather than just cancelling all the things.

We've learned the logistics of setting up online meetups, and attendees are gradually getting familiarised with the online style, who knows, it's a bit like innovation out of necessity but perhaps after all this blows over, we would have an additional format for meetups that might be more accessible to folks who cannot physically show up.

 👾👾👾

I would like to end off by saying how thankful and blessed I feel to be part of this community. I am grateful to the community leaders who took me under their wing, to every volunteer who has offered to help out with our meetup, to every speaker who chose to share their knowledge and to everyone who has showed up or thought about showing up to our meetup before. The thought does count.

So thank you everyone, for allowing us to be consistently anyhowly for more than 4 years.
