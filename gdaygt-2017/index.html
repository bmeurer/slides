    <meta name="description" content="2017 was the year of CSS grid, a powerful tool that was developed specially to do layout on the web. It allows us to do many things that we couldn't before, without extreme measures of hackish-ness. It is definitely not hyperbole to say that CSS grid will revolutionise web design moving forward.">

              <p>Within the short span of the web's life, we've seen web layouts evolve as browser technologies and web standards matured. In the web's infancy, there was no layout whatsoever. We were still amazed that the web even existed.</p>
              <p>Then, during the pre-school age of the web, we started to use tables to do layout. And that was fun, because like most kindergarteners, everything seemed like a good idea. There were all sorts of crazy, creative layouts on the web.</p>
              <p>But when we got to the pre-teen era, things started to conform a little more. We got a bit more self-concious, a little less radical, it wasn't that cool to be different. Float-based layouts to build sites with headers, sidebars and footers were the most socially acceptable.</p>
              <p>By high school, life had gotten complicated, and angsty. CSS was hard. Responsive design, what? People suck. Browsers are broken. Oh, someone will do all that for me? Frameworks? Sure! I don't give a crap. So we ended up with sites that utilised very similar layouts.</p>

            <h2>CSS Grid arrives</h2>
            <img class="plain" data-src="img/grid-release.png">
            <aside class="notes">
                <p>But something big happened this year. CSS Grid was released. CSS Grid is a revolutionary feature that was designed specifically for doing layout on the web.</p>
                <p>All the other techniques we've used in the past, HTML tables, floats, even flexbox, were never meant for doing full page layouts. They were creative hacks we came up with to build the layouts that we wanted.</p>
                <p>So this is the year web layouts come of age. We now have a level of control over how elements are rendered on the browser that we've never had before, with CSS grid. And when used in combination with other properties, like CSS shapes, transforms, viewport units and so on, the design possibilities become endless.</p>

            <blockquote>“Our ‘Age of Anxiety’ is, in great part, the result of trying to do today's job with yesterday's tools—with yesterday's concepts.”<br><small>—Marshall McLuhan</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I was reading a book called “The Medium is the Massage” by Marshall McLuhan the other day and came across this quote. And I couldn't help but think about the way we build layouts on the web.</p>
              <p>The thing about working on the web is that things move fast. In less than 3 decades, browser technologies have advanced a great deal. I first encountered the web when I was 11 years old, and I would never have imagined the web of today.</p>
              <p>A lot of frustration we have when designing for the web comes about from trying to build using yesterday's tools. Because yesterday, browsers weren't this smart. Yesterday, I had to tell my designer no, that can't be built. Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play.</p>
              <p>Sorry, that was lame. But my point is, the web is a medium like nothing we've seen before, and we need to adapt our mindsets to handle it.</p>
