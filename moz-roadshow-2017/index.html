    <meta name="description" content="Instead of seeing cross-browser compatibility as a chore and trying to make your design look exactly the same in every browser, why don't we embrace it as a feature? Depending on feature support, it is possible to create designs that work well on each browser while using the same codebase by utilising feature queries and developer tools like Browsersync.">

            <p>But we're not here to talk about me, we're here to talk about Bruce Lee. You may be thinking, what on earth does Bruce Lee have to do with any of this? Did you just fall victim to click-bait? No, you have not.</p>
            <p>I'm going to be putting forth some ideas today that I don't expect everyone to agree with, but I do hope you will hear me out. Anyway, although Bruce Lee is known for his fighting prowess, he was also a deeply self-reflective man and philosophy was an inseparable aspect of his martial arts practice.</p>

You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now water can flow, or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”<br><small>—Bruce Lee</small></blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">Now, content on the web behaves just like water. Rather than trying to wrangle every pixel into place, we need embrace the fact that content is meant to flow. If you try to make it fixed, like freezing water into ice, it's not going to fit into all the different screens that people will use to view it.</aside>

            <p>Look around you right now. This room is full of people. Human beings. And we are, for the most part, social creatures. We've taken over the planet largely because of our unique ability to communicate abstract thoughts and ideas.</p>
            <p>And we've been amazing with visual communication, right? We invented language and writing, and we wrote on almost everything, stone, jade, bamboo, various metals, silk. We also expressed ourselves through art, through dance, through fashion. And what all these media have in common, are that they have been around for thousands of years, people have had a long time to get used to them, and they are physical in nature.</p>

CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 and was developed into a W3C recommendation by 1996. The reason I'm throwing all these dates at you is to remind you that digital is less than a hundred years old. The web isn't even 30 yet, so it's really a very young medium.

            <p>Back in my day, every angsty teenager had their own blog where they would express their innermost thoughts and feelings in a lot more than 140 characters. The web had started to take off and not everybody wanted to spend a lot of time building their own websites from scratch. So a lot of these blogs were hosted on blogging platforms, like Blogspot. LiveJournal was a thing back then too. You could theme your blogs, and some people did, but most people just picked from whatever was available.</p>
            <p>This was around the time when screen sizes started to get bigger than 640 pixels, and now we had some extra space on our hands. So what did we do? We made sidebars! Sidebars with links to other blogs or sites, or contact information, if you were entrepreneurial you could chuck an ad or 2 in there.</p>

            <p>Now in the mid-2000s this was real hot. Because screen sizes had continued to grow, and so instead of 1 sidebar, why not have 2? But this layout wasn't easy to achieve, I mean, you could still use HTML tables, but come on, it was the 2000s. Cutting edge CSS with floats was the way to go.</p>
            <p>Except that it wasn't really. You see, floats weren't meant to used for layouts either. Like using HTML tables for layout, floats were also a hack, but they were all we had at the time to achieve the layouts we wanted. To fully grasp float-based layouts, you also needed to know about clearfix, about negative margins, have good arithmetic skills to calculate gaps. No, not easy at all.</p>

            <p>By this time, a lot of people just threw their hands up in surrender and outsourced the pain to CSS frameworks instead. And it's so understandable. Especially if they are not familiar with CSS, or they are short of time, or they just don't like CSS in general.</p>
            <p>But frameworks are quite prescriptive, and that's how we end up with a lot of websites that utilise very similar layouts. The flavour of the day at the moment is this panel style, you know, with content sectioned up in panes.</p>

            <p>With the maturation of web standards, browser behaviour is less unpredictable than before, though each browser still has their quirks. Features aren't all supported at the same time. But you know what? That's perfectly fine. If we accept this as a feature of the web, instead of a bug, we've just opened up more web design possibilities.</p>

            <p>CSS has been around for about 20 years now, and the last I checked, there were 499 distinct properties. And you don't have to know every single one of them, I'm just pointing out that we can achieve a lot more with CSS than ever before.</p>
            <p>So these are some of the CSS properties I find relevant for web layouts, too many for me to cover in half an hour. CSS is an integral part of web layout, and its really about combining different properties to create designs that are truly web.</p>

          </p>
          <aside class="notes">Feature queries are integral to making this approach feasible. And support for it is quite good, more than 90% of browsers support this, even Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <pre><code class="css">.selector {
  /* Styles that are supported in old browsers */
}

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And this is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored.</p>
            <p>This means we start off with the basic layout that works everywhere. It could be a single column, largely browser default UI elements, that sort of thing. Then we layer on styles based on the features we want to use.</p>

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>By organising our code in this manner, the browsers that do not support feature queries or the specified property still get styled, while those that do get a different look. We're making use of the ‘C’ in CSS.</p>
            <p>The layout on the left is what IE11 users will see, the one in the middle is what Firefox users will see, because Firefox doesn't support CSS shapes yet, but once it does, it will then look like the layout on the right, which is what Chrome users see now.</p>
            <p>And yes, this approach does require a level of familiarity with CSS, but it's not rocket science. It boils down to experience, and the willingness to embrace CSS for what it is. With that in mind, let's talk about what we can use for web layouts.</p>

            <p>For flex children, the key property is <code>flex</code>. It is strongly recommended that we use the <code>flex</code> shorthand rather than each of the individual long-hand properties. First value for amount of growth, second value for amount of shrinkage and last value being the starting width before free space is distributed.</p>
            <p>Anyhoo, <code>flex</code> comes with some handy keyword values for commonly-desired effects, as shown in this table. If we don't set the flex value on a flex child, it's default behaviour is cannot grow, will shrink.</p>

            <p>A common issue I hear is that it's difficult to create a grid system with Flexbox. The thing about Flexbox is, even though you can make a grid system with it, it isn't the best idea to do so.</p>
            <p>Flexbox is suited for laying out items in a single dimension. Where there isn't a relationship between the rows and columns. Think of it more like a daisy chain of flex children.</p>
            <p>Here, I have a list of images. Once I apply <code>display: flex</code>, all the items are shrunk and laid out in a single row. If I turn on wrap, they all revert to their original size because now there is no limit to how much space they need to take up, if there is no space, the image will just drop down to the next row.</p>
            <p>I'll turn on the border so you can see how each flex child behaves. Now instead of the initial behaviour of can shrink no grow, I'll change it to can grow no shrink and make the images take up the width of the child container. Now, there are a lot of options we can play with in terms of designing the whole layout.</p>
            <p>I can do an <code>align-items: center</code> and create this jagged look, which is kinda interesting. Sometimes I find neat grids a bit monotonous. But if we want neat, we can also standardise the height of the flex children. Yeah, this makes the aspect ratio screwed up, so we compromise by cropping off the taller images with the <code>object-fit</code> property.</p>

            <p>I can also change the direction of the layout by setting <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> and giving the container a defined height. Now I've got this horizontal scroll going on.</p>
            <p>Again, we can go with the funky, jagged look by adjusting the flex children's alignment. Now that the flex direction has changed, the block and inline axes has also changed. <code>justify-content</code> shifts along the vertical axis, while <code>align-items</code> shifts along the horizontal axis.</p>
            <p>Or we could go neat, and do the cropping thing again. Remove the alignment code, make the flex children totally flexible and images fill up their containers' heights. <code>calc()</code> is an indispensable function I use when creating layouts. Here, <code>calc()</code> let's me account for the margins of each image with respect to their container heights. I can fix the widths of the images to get something like this.</p>
            <p>And these layouts I just showed are making use of the behaviour of Flexbox, they were not hacks. These are actual options that we have when it comes to designing our layouts.</p>

          <aside class="notes">So this is the basic premise of how grid works. You define the grid, then place items in it either by yourself, or let the browser do it for you. Now, there are a myriad of options for both these actions, which is what makes grid so powerful, and why some people may find it intimidating at first. Let's see how Grid works when we let the browser do the placement.</aside>

          </video>
          <aside class="notes">With Grid, we can do all the things we're used to doing, except more easily. Like this fixed grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function really comes in handy when your columns or rows follow a similar pattern. In this case, I'm telling the browser to give me five 10em wide columns. It's fixed, so no size changes here.</aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Fluid CSS grid</h2>

            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Grid also introduces the <code>fr</code> unit, which represents a fraction of the free space in the grid container. In this example, I'm telling the browser I want each of my five columns to take up equal proportions of free space available. And so, they shrink and grow together with container.</aside>

        <section>
          <h2>Responsive CSS grid</h2>
          <pre><code class="css" style="font-size: 90%;">.container {

          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Now this is something new we've never been able to do before. The <code>minmax()</code> function lets me tell the browser that I want to cap the shrink at 10ems but if there's extra space, grow all my columns equally. Because of the cap, once there isn't enough space to fit 5 columns, the number of columns will decrease until everything fits. Didn't need a single media query for that.</aside>

            <p>We can also name areas of the grid with the <code>grid-template-area</code> property, which I find great for white-space because you can create empty cells, using the dot notation.</p>
            <p>Placement then involves telling the grid item which area it needs to go into, like how I'm going to shift the sixth shoe into grid area “f”.</p>

            <p>Here's a simple example of overlap, just two circles behind a header. The code here is simplified to show only the placement properties. But to centre the text, I applied a <code>align-self: center</code> and <code>text-align: center</code> to the header.</p>
            <p>Pseudo-elements are treated as children. So the two circles here are pseudo-elements of the grid container, which have been explicitly placed to overlap. Then the header overlaps them both.</p>
            <p>The placement code is more intuitive than using absolute positioning and you don't need to do a lot of complicated math to get the alignment just right no matter how you resize the browser.</p>

            <p>Designing layouts on the web requires interpolative thinking, on multiple levels. Web layouts can and most probably should morph as the viewport size changes. Our job is to make sure the layout is most effective in the space it has to perform in.</p>
            <p>There are more media queries available to us than just <code>min-width</code> and <code>max-width</code>. Like in this example, I'm using the <code>min-aspect-ratio</code> media query which triggers my fancier overlap layout only when the aspect-ratio is more than 1.</p>

To toggle it, click on the waffle-like icon next to <code>display:grid</code> on your grid container element. It will then show all the grid lines and you can see where your grid items have been placed on the grid.</aside>
