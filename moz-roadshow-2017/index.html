Depending on feature support, it is possible to create designs that work well on each browser while using the same codebase by utilising feature queries and developer tools like Browsersync.">

            <p>Look around you right now. This room is full of people. Human beings. And we are, for the most part, social creatures. We've taken over the planet largely because of our unique ability to communicate abstract thoughts and ideas.</p>
            <p>And we've been amazing with visual communication, right? We started off with cave paintings. We invented language and writing, and we wrote on everything, stone, jade, bamboo, all kinds of metals, silk. We also expressed ourselves through art, through dance, through fashion. And what all these mediums have in common, are that they have been around for thousands of years, people have had a long time to get used to them, and they are physical in nature.</p>

CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 and was developed into a W3C recommendation by 1996. The reason I'm throwing all these dates at you is to remind you that digital is less than a hundred years old. The web isn't even 30 yet, so it's really a very young medium.

            <p>Back in my day, every angsty teenager had their own blog where they would express their innermost thoughts and feelings in a lot more than 140 characters. The web had started to take off and not everybody wanted to spend a lot of time building their own websites from scratch. So a lot of these blogs were hosted on blogging platforms, like Blogspot. LiveJournal was a thing back then too. You could theme your blogs, and some people did, then everyone else more or less just picked from those.</p>
            <p>This was around the time when screen sizes started to get bigger than 640 pixels, and now we had some extra space on our hands. So what did we do? We made sidebars! Sidebars with links to other blogs or sites, or contact information, if you were entrepreneurial you could chuck an ad or 2 in there.

            <p>Now in the mid-2000s this was real hot. Because screen sizes had continued to grow, and so instead of 1 sidebar, why not have 2? But this layout wasn't easy to achieve, I mean, you could still use HTML tables, but come on, it was the 2000s. Cutting edge CSS with floats was the way to go.</p>
            <p>Except that it wasn't really. You see, floats weren't meant to used for layouts either. Like using HTML tables for layout, floats were also a hack, but they were all we had at the time to achieve the layouts we wanted. To fully grasp float-based layouts, you also needed to know about clearfix, about negative margins, have good arithmetic skills to calculate gaps. No, not easy at all.</p>

            <p>But frameworks are quite prescriptive, and that's how we end up with a lot of websites that utilise very similar layouts. The flavour of the day at the moment is this panel style, you know, with content sectioned up in panes.</p>

            <p>This is a very basic use-case for Flexbox. Centring stuff. When I first learnt Flexbox, I hadn't fully grasped box alignment yet, so I just took whatever information I could glean from others' blog posts and articles. I used to centre items by applying <code>align-items: center</code> and <code>justify-content: center</code> to the parent container.</p>
            <p>This technique works just fine, but I only found out much later that if there's only 1 flex child, <code>margin: auto;</code> works just fine.</p>
            <p>When you have more than 1 item, an understanding of box alignment makes things much easier. Say we want to centre both these children. Setting <code>justify-content: center</code> aligns them along the inline-axis, while setting <code>align-content: center</code> aligns them along the block-axis. Flexbox by default lays out all its children in one line without wrapping, so change that to <code>wrap</code>. Wrap only kicks in when the content is longer than the container, so make the width of one of the children <code>100%</code>.</p>
            <p>There's a difference between <code>align-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, where content controls alignment of the box's content within its content box, and items specifies the behaviour for each individual child.</p>

            <p>A common issue I hear is that it's difficult to create a grid system with Flexbox. The thing about Flexbox is, even though you can make a grid system with it, it isn't the best idea to do so.</p>
            <p>Flexbox is suited for laying out items in a single dimension. Where there isn't a relationship between the rows and columns. Think it as laying out a daisy chain of flex children.</p>

          <h2>Feature Queries</h2>

            <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries"><img class="plain" data-src="img/caniuse-feature-queries.jpg"></a>
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">Feature queries are integral to making this approach feasible. And support for it is quite good, more than 90% of browsers support this, even Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <pre><code class="css">.selector {
  /* Styles that are supported in old browsers */
}

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">So this is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored. By organising our code in this manner, the browsers that do not support feature queries or the specified property still get styled, while those that do get a different look. We're making use of the ‘C’ in CSS.</aside>
