# Web Typography: where East meets West

*For Webconf.Asia 2017. This is sort of a transcript of the talk.*

大家好！The last time I was in Hong Kong was 1998, so it's been a while. I'm really excited to be here to talk to all of you about two of my favourite things, both are in my talk title. But before we get to that, let me introduce myself...with emojis.

My name is Hui Jing, and I'm Malaysian. I played basketball for more than half my life, and it was actually what got me into web development in the first place. I'm a front-end engineer based in Singapore now, and I love CSS so much that I will write blog posts about it. I also run Talk.CSS, which is Singapore's only CSS-centric meetup at the moment.

So in case I wasn't clear earlier, the two favourite things I was talking about were the web and typography. Let's first talk a bit about the Web. The web and the internet are actually not the same thing. The internet is the entire network of networks that connect all the world's devices to each other. And it was conceived of by a group of very smart, talented individuals working out of the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1958. These internet pioneers were the ones who came up with the concepts and protocols that form the backbone of this indispensable communication tool that literally changed the world.

Now, the web is much more recent, formally invented by Sir Tim Berners-Lee on March 12, 1989 as a means for researchers to share information. And this is what he wrote in an open letter during the web's 28th birthday back in March.

> “I imagined the web as an open platform that would allow everyone everywhere to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries.”

The purpose of the web is to connect the world's population, to allow people who live half a planet away to become friends. To share your experiences with friends 20km or 20,000km away from you. Both the internet and the web were built to be open. No centralised control, you didn't have to ask anyone's permission to publish a website. You could just go ahead and do it. If your friend from Argentina has a website, you can just type in that URL to see it. You don't need a visa or a passport. There are no national boundaries online. To me, that is amazing.

Bruce Lawson is here today. And I'm very thankful for the chance to meet him. I want to highlight a point he made in his article earlier this year, that according to the GSMA Intelligence report on consumer barriers to mobile internet adoption in Asia:

> A lack of awareness and locally relevant content was the most commonly cited barrier to internet adoption: 72% of non-internet users across the six survey markets felt this was a barrier.

The report goes on to say:

> At present, the world’s linguistic and cultural diversity is not reflected in the content and services available online. A great deal of the content available to Asian users is simply translated into local languages and does not reflect the significant cultural diversity found across the region.

Roughly 17% of the world's population are native Chinese speakers, and yet only 2% of websites are in Chinese. In contrast, an estimated 51% of the world's websites are in English, when native English speakers make up around 5% of the world's population. The fact that digital computing originated from places that were predominantly English-speaking plays a big role in that.

But I do think that internationalisation efforts have been substantial over the years, and will continue to be for years to come. All the work coming out of the Unicode Consortium has been significant in this regard, with the goal to be able to represent every character in any system, regardless of platform, program or language. And that's the reason why it is recommended by the W3C that you always choose the UTF-8 character encoding for your content or data.

Now let's move on to typography. I've come across numerous definitions of typography over the years, and have personally settled on this one by Gerrit Noordzij, that it is writing with prefabricated letters. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language. If you think about it, almost every writing system in the world today seems to be alphabetic, where individual letters are combined to form words to convey meaning.

But Chinese is different. Chinese is currently the only logographic writing system that is widely used by millions of people. This means each individual character has meaning on its own. Until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese language was an indigenous invention, developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.

Let's broadly look at how the nature of Western languages in Europe differ from the Eastern languages in Asia. The Phoenician alphabet is considered the origin of many alphabetic writing systems on which the Greek, Latin and Roman alphabets were based on. In such languages, letters represent sounds of the spoken language, and are used in combinations to form words that convey meaning. In contrast, a logograph is a written character that itself represents a word.

With alphabets, you have a small set of letters used in lots of different variations to express different meanings. With Chinese characters, we have thousands upon thousands to individual glyphs that can express meaning on their own or used in combination with others. This has a direct consequence on the structure of the language itself. For example:

And of course, this had very 

A language is intrinsically tied in with the culture that uses it.

Overview of typography (roots in handwriting), Western and Eastern (Chinese) and how they evolved differently
Type is a tool for communication, purpose never changed, though medium has
Understand the medium we're working with, in this case, the browser
Traditional print typeset with metal slugs, the web uses CSS to set type; font-related features like writing-mode, text-orientation, also font-feature-settings for opentype features
Features that are unique to the web medium, like responsive typography, use of viewport units, fluid layouts
Design to fit the context in which typography serves its purpose most effectively
both Latin type and Chinese type.
And talk about pages that have both Latin and Chinese text, like font pairing, layout, typesetting margins etc
