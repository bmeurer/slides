            <p>I'm going to be putting forth some ideas today that I don't expect everyone to agree with, but I do hope you will hear me out. Although Bruce Lee is known for his fighting prowess, he was also a deeply self-reflective man and philosophy was an inseparable aspect of his martial arts practice.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Content on the web behaves just like water. Rather than trying to wrangle every pixel into place, we need embrace the fact that content is meant to flow.

            <p>The digital age started around the 1940s when the first electronic computers came about and screens were introduced as an output device in the 50s.</p>
            <p>Before this, we've always used physical media as a means of visual communication, from writing on all kinds of surfaces, to creating art, paintings and sculptures, or even physical expression through dance and performance.</p>
            <p>But an electronic display is a proxy medium. Whatever we see displayed on a screen comes from data encoded as electronic signals. The heart of electronic displays is light. It is transient. We cannot touch light.</p>

          <aside class="notes">When it comes to the web, HTML was invented in 1989 by Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And the first graphical web browsers were released around 1992. CSS was proposed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994 and was developed into a W3C recommendation by 1996. The reason I'm throwing all these dates at you is to remind you that digital is less than a hundred years old. The web isn't even 30 yet. Listen, the web is a millennial, think about that the next time it pisses you off. It's really a very young medium. The likes of which we've never seen before.</aside>

            <p>Back in my day, every angsty teenager had their own blog where they would express their innermost thoughts and feelings in a lot more than 140 characters.</p>
            <p>The web had started to take off and not everybody wanted to spend a lot of time building their own websites from scratch. Most blogs were hosted on blogging platforms, where you picked a cool theme from the pool of available options.</p>
            <p>This was around the time when screen sizes started to get bigger than 640 pixels. Because we can't have extra space lying around doing nothing, we decided sidebars were a good idea. Sidebars with links to other blogs or sites, or contact information, if you were entrepreneurial you could chuck an ad or 2 in there.</p>

            <p>By the mid-2000s, screen sizes had continued to grow, so instead of 1 sidebar, why not have 2? But this particular layout wasn't easy to achieve, I mean, you could still use HTML tables, but come on, it was the 2000s. Cutting edge CSS with floats was the way to go.</p>
            <p>Not. You see, floats weren't meant to used for layouts either. Like using HTML tables for layout, floats were also a hack, but they were all we had at the time to achieve the layouts we wanted. To fully grasp float-based layouts, you also needed to know about clearfix, about negative margins, have good arithmetic skills to calculate gaps. No, not easy at all.</p>

          <p>and many more...</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>People access information on the web predominantly through browsers. And we do have a lot of them. But they are powered largely by four main layout engines, Blink by Google, Gecko by Mozilla, EdgeHTML by Microsoft and Webkit by Apple.</p>
            <p>With the maturation of web standards, browser behaviour is less unpredictable than before, though each browser still has their quirks. Features aren't all supported at the same time. But you know what? That's perfectly fine. If we accept this as a feature of the web, instead of a bug, we've just opened up a lot more web design possibilities.</p>

          <h2>Feature Queries</h2>

            <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries"><img class="plain" data-src="img/caniuse-feature-queries.jpg"></a>
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">Feature queries are key to making this approach feasible. And support for it is really good, with coverage in over 90% of browsers, including Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile.</aside>
        </section>

        <section>
          <pre><code class="css">.selector {
  /* Styles that are supported in old browsers */
}

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And this is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored.</p>
            <p>This means we start off with the basic layout that works everywhere. It could be a float-based layout, or even single column, maybe largely browser default UI elements, that sort of thing. Then we layer on styles based on the features we want to use.</p>
            <p>By organising our code in this manner, the browsers that do not support feature queries or the specified property still get styled, while those that do get a different look. We're making use of the ‘C’ in CSS. Call it ‘Cascading Web Design’. If this concept ever takes off, remember you heard it here first.</p>

          </div>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>In this example, the layout on the left is what IE11 users will see, the one in the middle is what Firefox users will see, because Firefox doesn't support CSS shapes yet, but once it does, it will then look like the layout on the right, which is what Chrome users see now.</p>
            <p>And yes, this approach does require a level of familiarity with CSS, but it's not rocket science. It boils down to experience, and the willingness to embrace CSS for what it is. With that in mind, let's talk about what we can use for web layouts.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>The most basic use-case for Flexbox is centring stuff. When I first learnt Flexbox, I hadn't fully grasped box alignment yet. I used to centre items by applying <code>align-items: center</code> and <code>justify-content: center</code> to the parent container because all the blog posts said so.</p>
            <p>This technique works just fine, but I only found out much later that if there's only 1 flex child, <code>margin: auto;</code> does the same thing.</p>
            <p>When you have more than 1 item, an understanding of box alignment makes things much easier. Say we want to centre both these children. Setting <code>justify-content: center</code> aligns them along the inline-axis, while setting <code>align-items: center</code> aligns them along the block-axis. Flexbox by default lays out all its children in one line without wrapping, so change that to <code>wrap</code>. Wrap only kicks in when the content is longer than the container, so make the width of one of the children <code>100%</code>.</p>
            <p>There's a difference between <code>align-content</code> and <code>align-items</code>, where content controls alignment of all the `content` as a unified block within the parent container, while `items` aligns items along the flex line.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>When it comes to flex children, the key property is <code>flex</code>. It is strongly recommended that we use the <code>flex</code> shorthand rather than each of the individual long-hand properties. First value for amount of growth, second value for amount of shrinkage and last value being the starting width before free space is distributed.</p>
            <p><code>flex</code> comes with some handy keyword values for commonly desired effects, as shown in this table. If we don't set the flex value on a flex child, its default behaviour is cannot grow, will shrink.</p>

            <p>A common issue I hear is that it's difficult to create a grid system with Flexbox. The thing about Flexbox is, even though you can make a grid system with it, it probably isn't the best idea to do so.</p>
            <p>Flexbox is suited for laying out items in a single dimension. Where there isn't a relationship between the rows and columns. Think of it more like a daisy chain of flex children.</p>
            <p>Here, I have a list of images. Once I apply <code>display: flex</code>, all the items are shrunk and laid out in a single row. If I turn on wrap, they all revert to their original size because now there is no limit to how much space they need to take up, if there is no space, the image will just drop down to the next row, the next flex line.</p>
            <p>I'll turn on the border so you can see how each flex child behaves. Now instead of the initial behaviour of can shrink don't grow, I'll change it to can grow don't shrink and make the images take up the width of the child container. Now, there are a lot of options we can play with in terms of designing the whole layout.</p>
            <p>I can do an <code>align-items: center</code> and create this jagged look, which we don't see all that often on the web. Sometimes I find neat grids a bit monotonous. But if I have to, we can do that by standardising the height of the flex children. This makes the aspect ratio screwed up, so a compromise could be cropping off the taller images with the <code>object-fit</code> property.</p>

            <p>I can also change the direction of the layout by setting <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> and giving the container a defined height. Now I've got this horizontal scroll going on.</p>
            <p>And we can play around with the alignment of the items. Now that the flex direction has changed, the block and inline axes has also changed. <code>justify-content</code> shifts along the vertical axis, while <code>align-items</code> shifts along the horizontal axis.</p>
            <p>Maybe this new-age hippy layout isn't everyone's thing, that's fine. Remove the alignment code, make the flex children totally flexible and images fill up their containers' heights. <code>calc()</code> is an indispensable function I use when creating layouts. Here, <code>calc()</code> let's me account for the margins of each image with respect to their container heights. I can fix the widths of the images to get something like this.</p>
            <p>And these layouts are a demonstration of what Flexbox can do out-of-the-box. They are not hacks. These are native options that we have when it comes to designing our layouts.</p>

          <aside class="notes">So this is the basic premise of how grid works. You define the grid, then place items in it either by yourself, or let the browser do it for you. Now, there are a myriad of options for both these actions, which is what makes grid so powerful, and why some people may find it intimidating at first. Let's see how Grid works when we let the browser do the placement.</aside>

          </video>
          <aside class="notes">With Grid, we can do all the things we're used to doing, except more easily. Like this fixed grid. The <code>repeat()</code> function really comes in handy when your columns or rows follow a similar pattern. In this case, I'm telling the browser to give me five 10em wide columns. It's fixed, so no size changes here.</aside>

          <h2>Fluid CSS grid</h2>

            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Grid also introduces the <code>fr</code> unit, which represents a fraction of the free space in the grid container. In this example, I'm telling the browser I want each of my five columns to take up equal proportions of free space available. And so, they shrink and grow together with container.</aside>

          <h2>Responsive CSS grid</h2>
          <pre><code class="css" style="font-size: 90%;">.container {

}</code></pre>

          </video>
          <aside class="notes">Now this is something new we've never been able to do before. The <code>minmax()</code> function lets me tell the browser that I want to cap the shrink at 10ems but if there's extra space, grow all my columns equally. Because of the cap, once there isn't enough space to fit 5 columns, the number of columns will decrease until everything fits. Didn't need a single media query for that.</aside>

            <p>By default, a grid item will occupy one grid cell, but we can use the <code>span</code> keyword to define how many grid tracks an item should take up. We refer to the grid lines using their numerical index, starting from 1.</p>

            <p>We can also name areas of the grid with the <code>grid-template-areas</code> property, which I find great for white-space because you can create empty cells, using the dot notation.</p>
            <p>Placement then involves telling the grid item which area it needs to go into, like how I'm going to shift the sixth shoe into grid area “f”.</p>

            <p>The placement code is more intuitive than using absolute positioning and you don't need to do a lot of complicated math to get the alignment just right no matter how you resize the browser.</p>

It was an image on the actual article, but I felt it was something that definitely could be “web-ified”.</p>
            <p>So on a narrow screen, diagonals may not be a good idea, but once we have enough space, why not? Again, for browsers that don't support Transforms or Grid, we can still present a layout that doesn't use those properties with the help of feature queries. Remember, things on the web don't need to look the same all the time.</p>

            <p>With 3D transforms, we are operating with one more axis, which is the z-axis, for depth. So there are some additional properties like <code>backface-visibility</code> and <code>perspective</code>, for example. The <code>perspective</code> property controls how far an element appears to recede into the horizon. The smaller the value, the more dramatic the 3D effect is.</p>
            <p>So if I change the value of <code>perspective</code> here to something smaller, you can see that the horizon recedes much further away.</p>

          <aside class="notes">This example demonstrates the <code>writing-mode</code> property's different values. There's <code>vertical-rl</code> in red, where the text runs from right to left. And <code>vertical-lr</code> in blue, where the text runs from left to right. We can also apply a rotate to make the text face the opposite direction, like the green example. But how can we use this in the context of a Latin-based writing system?</aside>

          <aside class="notes">One idea is for headers. It might not be the best idea to layout long chunks of text vertically because that just makes it hard to read. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.</aside>

            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos, 
            but don't worry, you can <a href="videos/menu.mp4">download it</a>
            and watch it with your favourite video player!
          </video>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Also, depending on the number of links in your navigation menu, perhaps a vertical layout on a narrow screen could be a design option worth considering.</p>
            <p>Today's CSS really gives us a lot more creative choices as compared to when responsive design first was a thing back in 2010.</p>

            <p>Jen Simmons and Rachel Andrew have done a lot for both developing layout on the web, as well as educating the web development community about it. Rachel has a CSS layout course which is completely online, and Jen Simmons has a wonderful collection of demos which you can check out.</p>
            <p>Speaking of demos, I think everyone should build up their own collection of demos, because that's the best way to learn and familiarise ourselves with CSS in general.</p>
