# Vertical writing on the web: inadvertent layout inspiration from a search for cultural identity

*For Smashing Conference San Francisco 2018. This is sort of a transcript of the talk.*

Hello everyone! It has been an amazing conference thus far, hasn't it? With so many incredible speakers who have really expanded my horizons, and I feel blessed to be able to share the stage with all of them.

The title of my talk is quite a mouthful, but it is a pretty good summary of what the next 40 minutes will entail. A bit about the web, a bit about culture, some writing and a dash of layout thrown in for good measure.

I doubt anybody has ever heard of me, so some introductions are probably in order. My name is Hui Jing, I go by Jing as well, and I'm from Malaysia. I used to play basketball full time and it was what kick-started my web career. My inordinate love of CSS is what compels me to write and speak about this topic. I also happen to be a Mozilla TechSpeaker, which is an initiative by Mozilla that supports technical evangelists in regional communities around the world by providing resources and funding.

Smashing has been around since 2006, and it has always been focused on the web. Offering practical resources for designers and developers to create and build for this medium. So I would like to start off by asking everyone here, what does the web mean to you?

## On the web

Personally, I love the web. Last month, I read a book called “Weaving the Web”, which is the story of the World Wide Web, told by its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he mentioned that there was no ‘Eureka’ moment, no ‘an-apple-hit-me-on-the-head’ kind of event, when it came to inventing the web.

For him, inventing the World Wide Web involved a growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, web-like manner.

Unlike computers, which are absolutely great at following step-by-step instructions, but fail terribly at making random associations, the human mind has a special ability to link random bits of information and connect seemingly unrelated ideas to generate new ones.

Many of the technical decisions around the web arose because of the key idea of universality, that one information space could encompass all the different documentation systems out there.

We're talking about the ability to easily create a link from one document to another, across different organisations or institutions, without needing to merge databases or even have direct access to the other system. This was the premise the web was built upon.

I didn't come from a rich family, but I was really lucky to have grown up with a computer in the house. Key functions of the computers from my childhood included, the 5.25 inch floppy drive, and the wonderfully clicky turbo button. I had no idea what it did at the time, but loved to press it anyway.

And my first experience with the web sounded something like this. This is music to my ears. If you've never heard this before, well, you're obviously not from my generation. It blows my mind to think about how the web can connect people from opposite sides of the planet.

Without the web, the odds of me being here are rather slim. Without the web, the chances of us ever crossing paths would be practically anorexic at best. And I would definitely not be standing up here, telling you this story about the web and reminiscing about my youth.

## On growing up Southeast-Asian

Has anybody watched Star Trek Discovery? Any fans of the show here today? For all the non-sci-fi people, Star Trek and Star Wars are not the same thing. There are no cute furry creatures in Star Trek.

Some of you may recognise this beautiful woman up here from Star Trek Discovery, or films like Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. She is Michelle Yeoh, one of the greatest action stars of all time and the pride of Malaysians everywhere.

When she first got to Hollywood, people were amazed that she could speak English so well. And she, in turn, was equally amazed that people in Hollywood had such a limited grasp of world geography, seeing as they did not know where Malaysia was.

I'm sure many people from America and Europe know exactly where Southeast Asia is. I mean, it's sort of self-explanatory, it's the South-Eastern section of Asia. But then again, I have also met people whose idea of Asia was limited to, China, India or Japan. Maybe they hadn't learned not to eat soggy waffles yet.

Southeast Asia is made up of 11 countries, and every single one of them has their own distinct culture. English is taught in schools across the region, but we have so many other languages as well.

Southeast Asia was heavily colonised by European powers starting from the 16th century, with Thailand being the only territory to avoid that fate. After the second World War, many colonies fought for their right to be independent sovereign states. Independence is always a struggle, like the Chinese saying 万事开头难, that states every beginning is difficult.

As nascent countries, which were also ex-European colonies, there was an inevitable self-deprecation, a sentiment of Western superiority. It's a frame of mind that still lingers a little to this day. Because you cannot just declare independence and expect the culture and mindset of people who were occupied for generations to change overnight.

I grew up in Malaysia and Singapore. Both countries a melting pot of cultures, races and languages. All around me, I could see street signs in Jawi and Latin characters, store-fronts with signs printed in Chinese and Malay. I read novels in Chinese, storybooks in English. All around me, the physical world was filled with writing systems in all directions.

But in the digital world, everything was horizontal, top-to-bottom. And when you're a kid, you don't really think too much about such things. I had just assumed that was the way things worked. That in the digital world, interfaces would always be left-to-right. And almost always in English.

## On internationalisation

Of the world's 7.6 billion people, only 5% are native English speakers, but 52% of websites are in English. Something isn't quite right about this ratio.

Language is an integral part of a society's cultural heritage, and a means to preserve it. As the world gradually moves toward the digital medium, it is crucial that we promote the creation of locally relevant content.

The web is an informational medium, where people go online to find out about things. Like Yiying said yesterday, content is king. The web is only useful to people who can understand the content on it.

Which is why I'm slightly comforted to know that Internationalisation is a priority at the W3C. It is crucial that a technology meant to be ubiquitous supports the creation of local content across the world. That every writing system in the world can be correctly rendered on the web.

Just to prove a point, these are the various scripts in use in Southeast Asia, and they can all be displayed and laid out correctly on the web now. With better unicode support and font technologies for individual characters, as well as various CSS properties for overall layout, we now have the means to carve out a space on the web that truly belongs to each of us. That truly feels like home.

## On typography

So here's another question, do developers even care about typography? When I was asked this, I thought it was a ridiculous question. In my mind, I was like, of course they do. But I'm wrong about a lot of things. So how many of you think typography is important?

Typography has always been an integral part of Human-Computer Interaction and software design. Rendering text and graphics on an electronic screen is no easy task.

If you really think about it, anything we see on a screen has everything to do with the field of computer graphics. And digital typography is really a cross-disciplinary field involving technical engineering, aesthetic design and mathematical precision.

There are many definitions of Typography out there, and the one I've settled on is by Gerrit Noordzij, that typography is writing with prefabricated letters. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language.

There's probably a pretty diverse mix of languages spoken by the audience here today, and while a large number of those languages are alphabetic, Chinese is not one of them.

## On language and writing

Chinese is a logographic writing system, where each character is composed within a uniform square. This allows Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.

And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese script developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.

This is why the Western languages in Europe are inherently different from the Eastern languages in Asia. Alphabetic languages, which originated from the Phoenician alphabet, combine a small set of letters to form all the words that the language needs for the purpose of communication.

Chinese characters, on the other hand, number in the tens of thousands. Each a unique glyph that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs.

For example, Hippopotamus, an English word of 12 letters. Chinese only needs 2 characters, 河马.

Lebensgefährte (Lee-bin-skir-fear-te), German word of 14 characters. In Chinese, we can say 伴侣.

Grianghrafadóireachta (Green-hra-fer-doi-rek-te), Irish word of 21 letters. Again, 2 characters will do, 摄影. What can I say, Chinese is a concise language.

The appearance of the earliest letterforms was directly influenced by the tools that were used to create them, and continually evolved in tandem with the limitations of the technologies of their time.

Latin alphabets were derived from the Greek alphabet and the earliest Greek letters were sans-serif when writing was done with a hard reed pen. Serifs may have came about due to a transition to a square-cut writing implement, like a flat stiff brush.

Later scribes and copyists used quill pens and as demand for written matter grew, they developed more efficient styles of writing, evolving the letterforms yet again.

When it comes to classifying script styles, Latin-based scripts can broadly be put into two big categories, Serifs and Sans-serifs.

Chinese characters also changed a lot since their origins. It's just that Chinese writing went through the entire process of development and evolution way earlier than Europe.

The key implement of Chinese writing is the brush. Calligraphy was and still is one of the most highly regarded Chinese arts. The works of famous calligraphers were used as the basis for carving woodblocks used for printing.

These days, typefaces used for printing Chinese publications can be broadly classified into the following families: 宋体 (also known as 明体), 楷体, 仿宋体 and 黑体.

宋体 is the standard font for body copy. 楷体 is used for runs of text that need to be differentiated from the rest of the content, like dialogues or references. 黑体 is most commonly seen in digital publishing but publishers have started to experiment with 黑体 in print as well. 仿宋体 is generally used in isolated paragraphs like quotations or highlighted sentences.

There are actually a huge variety of other styles, like those based of ancient scripts like 篆书 or 隶书, as well as brush script styles mimicking running scripts like 草书 or 行书. But they fall into a broad category called 花式体, mostly used for display text or short paragraphs. Not so much for long form reading.

Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.

You may have come across this article on Quartz that covers the process of creating a Chinese font. I saw it make the rounds on Twitter again earlier this year. It's an interesting read, and I'll share the link later, if anyone's interested.

For a typeface to be viably used as body copy, it will probably need a minimum coverage of around 7000 glyphs for simplified Chinese or around 13,000 for traditional Chinese. That's still a lot of glyphs, hence Chinese fonts are almost always designed by teams over a period of years, not months.

Language and writing has allowed human beings to communicate ideas and record history for thousands of years. And we've written on almost anything we could get our hands on.

Right now, the medium of our time is the screen and the browser. Our types are now font files. And we've replaced typesetting using composing sticks with CSS.

I would like to point out though, that an electronic display is a proxy medium. Whatever we see displayed on a screen comes from data encoded as electronic signals. The heart of electronic displays is light. It is transient. We cannot touch light.

The web isn't even 30 yet, and this young medium is like nothing we've seen before. It is dynamic and interactive. Although it may be tempting to view the web as simply print expressed on an electronic screen, it is not. It is a unique medium of its own.

## On web fonts

When we talk about typography on the web, one of the first things that comes to mind is web fonts. So let's start off with some basics.

In world of metal typesetting, this is a font, which refers to a complete set of metal types that were used to typeset entire pages of text. This particular set being shown is for Caslon, 12pt.

In the digital world, these are fonts, specifically font files. For both analogue and digital fonts, you can think of them as collections of glyphs.

A glyph is the specific shape of a letter or character in a particular font. In the digital world, everything is data. So glyphs can be described with an array of pixels, or collections of vector images or even paths of Bézier curves and straight lines.

Different font formats store information about the font, like their glyphs, encodings, metadata about the font etc., differently based on how their specifications were written.

If you've ever used web fonts before, you would have seen these font formats. To understand how we got to this point, we need to go back a time a little bit. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which didn't work out so well when it came to high-resolution printing.

A lot of smart people worked on this problem. And one of the solutions came from Adobe founder, John Warnock. He created Postscript in 1985, the very first vector font, and it really took off.

TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Microsoft came up with TrueType Open in 1994 and eventually Adobe joined in and together they developed OpenType.

Microsoft also came up with EOT or embedded OpenType, a proprietary format for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF2 is an improvement over WOFF with significantly better compression rates.

On the practical side of things, we use the @font-face rule to declare a list of different font formats in the hopes that our fonts will show up correctly in as many browsers as possible. The number of font formats we need to declare has decreased over the years and right now, you can pretty much get away with declaring just WOFF and WOFF2.

## On font descriptors

The @font-face rule has more descriptors but only these 2, font-family and src, are mandatory.

If either of them are absent, the entire @font-face rule is ignored. The font-family descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So even if you're using say, Frutiger, you could actually call it “Dumplings” and it would still work.

The src descriptor is comma-separated list of external references or locally-installed font face names. It is made up of the declaration of the font file's location, and an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, it won't bother loading the font at all.

The next 3 descriptors, for style, weight and stretch, are used to match styles to a particular typeface in later declarations. Technically, you could assign a black typeface to a font-weight of 100 and proceed to confuse your colleagues who cannot figure out why setting a weight of 100 gives them this massively bold typeface. If office pranks are your thing...I'm just saying. #dontgetfired.

Then we have the unicode-range descriptor. which allows us to create composite fonts that mix glyphs from different fonts for different scripts.

Sometimes the Latin characters for Chinese fonts don't look particularly nice, this is more apparent on older Windows systems, to be honest. So we can use the unicode-range descriptor to specify a specific font file to be loaded for individual code points or range of code points.

In this example, I've created a font-family called Heiti Plus, which will use the Heiti SC font for everything, but the second rule tells the browser to use the Andika New Basic font for all Latin characters instead.

I really have to shoutout Firefox Devtools here, if you're doing a lot of design work in the browser, it's just awesome. It has the best Grid Inspector tool, a Flexbox inspector, I could go on.

But anyway, there's also the font panel that shows which fonts are loaded on your page. You can see that both Heiti SC and Andika New Basic are loaded for my custom font-family, Heiti Plus.

If a page does not contain any Latin characters, Andika New Basic will not be loaded at all because it is not needed.

All these font descriptors I've talked about thus far look very similar to CSS properties, but they are 2 completely different things.

Chris Lilley, who chaired the group that developed @font-face, explained it really well in his dotCSS talk. That properties are requests for styling and descriptors are descriptions of capabilities. A font-weight: bold; within a @font-face rule means this font can do bold. While a font-weight: bold; applied as a property means style this element with a font that can do bold.

## On CSS font properties

These here are CSS font properties. From what I've seen, properties like font-size, font-weight and font-style are pretty commonly used.

But font-stretch maybe a bit less. And the last 2, which are font-size-adjust and font-synthesis, I've almost never seen in the wild before. So let's touch on those 2, which were newly added to the Fonts Level 3 specification.

font-size-adjust was added to address legibility issues. Faces with low x-heights may sometimes be less legible, especially when they are triggered as fallback fonts. We can set the value of this property to the aspect ratio of the first choice font. Any fallback fonts triggered will have their font-size adjusted to match this ratio.

font-synthesis was put in to address the issue of faux bolds and faux italics. Sometimes the true italic or heavier version of a font does not exist so the browser will try to compensate. Unfortunately, the end result isn't pretty. Actually, most Chinese fonts don't have italic variants. With this property, you can set a value of none, to tell the browser to leave your font alone.



Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. Modern font technologies allow fonts to contain a lot more glyphs that before. So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on.

These features are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.

Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.

So these are the features you can turn on via CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.

Scarely anybody talks about font-variant-east-asian. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. If you're unfamiliar with Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs, but it depends. Han unification involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.

We won't get into that, but the point is, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese glyphs have their own specification known as JIS or Japanese Industrial Standard, and they too have alternate glyphs for the same character. This property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.

font-feature-settings allows us to toggle very specific OpenType properties. Last I checked, there were 141 OpenType feature tags to cover things like vertical kerning, unicase, scientific inferiors and so on.

Browser support for each of font-variant properties varies at the moment, with Firefox being the only browser that has supported all of them since version 34.0.

font-feature-settings, on the other hand, has quite good support across most browsers. Although, the specification recommends to utilise the respective font-variant properties over the font-feature-settings property, until browser support becomes more robust, I suppose we'll continue to see font-feature-settings being used instead.

Remember I mentioned OpenType earlier on? Well, in September 2016, version 1.8 of the specification introduced OpenType Font Variations. A joint development by Microsoft, Google, Apple and Adobe.

An OpenType variable font is one in which the equivalent of multiple individual fonts can be compactly packaged within a single font file, which can potentially be a big plus when it comes to performance. This is especially significant for fonts with large glyph sets, like CJK fonts.

In addition to that, the dynamism of variable fonts makes it perfect for the web medium, and opens up the possibility of new kinds of responsive typography.

Because variable fonts are so new, the W3C are still working on drafting out how variation axis values should be controlled via CSS in the Fonts Level 4 specification.

Currently, there are 5 common axes of variation that can be enabled by via the font-size, font-weight, font-stretch and font-style properties. There is also one new property defined in the specification for optical sizing. But as new variation axes become popular, more properties will be added to control those axes in future.

If I start talking about variable fonts in depth, I'll probably need one more session, so I won't do that. Some brilliant people have been building demos and writing articles about variable fonts, one of whom is Mandy Michael, who gave an amazing presentation in Singapore earlier this year. I'll share the link to that later as well.

font-variation-settings, like font-feature-settings are very low-level CSS properties that allow granular control of axes values.

Again, the specification recommends using the higher-level CSS properties whenever possible because this property was meant to be used as an escape hatch, not the main method of implementation.

If you're interested in seeing how variable fonts behave, you have to check out Axis Praxis by Laurence Penney, which is essentially a playground for the available variable fonts on the web. Taipei-based type foundry Arphic Technology AKA 文鼎科技 created the first Chinese variable font 文鼎晶熙黑, and you can play with it on Axis Praxis.

## On vertical writing

Vertical writing is traditionally East Asian. For Han characters, which are used in Chinese, Japanese and Korean. But when it comes to design, we can layout text in all directions if we so choose.

So I want to introduce the writing-mode property, which deals specifically with vertical text.

You literally turn the browser on its side. Some people might be saying, no big deal, we can do that with transforms too. Not exactly. Changing the writing-mode affects an elements box alignment axes.

This is what happens to your text when the different values of writing-mode are applied. The default is horizontal, top-to-bottom. To change the direction to vertical, we use vertical-rl or vertical-lr.

Now when we rotate text, it's not only the lines that change direction, because each line contains individual letters or characters. They have an orientation as well.

For text-orientation, the initial value is mixed. Browsers are smart enough to tell which languages can be typeset both vertically and horizontally, or in one direction only. So Chinese characters, for example, will always be displayed upright. While horizontal-only languages, will have their characters rotated when vertical.

The text-orientation property let's you control this, and make all the characters upright or sideways, if you want to.

One more relevant property is text-combine-upright. This addresses the issue of numerals and abbreviations in vertical text. A very common use case is dates, especially for Taiwan, where they use the 民國 calendar. This property lets us fit all the digits into the width of one character and display them upright.

No browser supports the digits value yet, which allows us to dictate how many digits are acceptable to be squeezed in. The range allowed is between 2 to 4 characters. For now, with the all value, there is no limit, so you could technically put hippopotamus in there and it will just look horribly squished.

Laying out content in a different direction does require a change in perspective. And I gleaned quite a few insights from working with vertical layout. For example, the techniques I was so used to for centring items worked a bit differently with a vertical layout.

To vertically centre a block, setting the top and bottom margins to auto actually does work, unlike in horizontal writing, which is great. But trying to centre something horizontally is an exercise in pain.

These directions of top, right, bottom, left start getting a bit confusing when you have rotated Latin text. Say you have this header, and you want some extra spacing between the header and the paragraph, is the margin set on the bottom or the left? It's actually the left.

And Rachel also mentioned this yesterday. The CSS Logical Properties specification. So instead of left or right, we use properties like block-start and block-end or inline-start and inline-end.

If you haven't actually read Rachel's article yet, I'm plugging it again right now. The first public working draft of the specification was published in December last year, and I'm eager to see it developed and more widely implemented.

When I started this talk, I mentioned how I had assumed the digital world was always going to be left-to-right when I was a kid. And I had carried that assumption for quite a while. Even when Chinese language support on my PC and the web got much better, I never really thought about the layout part of things.

It wasn't until a couple years back when I was in a crowded subway train, peeking over the shoulder of this guy reading a Chinese novel on his phone, that I started to think, hey, a vertical layout seems like it would work really well here. I wonder if it's possible to do that on the web...?

So that's how I fell into this rabbit hole of vertical typesetting on the web, and learning a lot more about the Chinese language. And as you can see from this demo, the answer to my original question is a resounding yes, with all 3 properties I covered earlier being showcased here.

This is a layout I built for displaying Chinese text with a toggle that allowed readers to switch between vertical and horizontal layouts. You know, because we can do that for Chinese. But it wasn't as straightforward as I thought it would be.

It was quite tricky to get the images to orientate correctly. It would have been nice to have a media query for writing modes so I could layout my images accordingly with the picture element, but that doesn't exist yet so I ended up working around the image issue with CSS transforms instead.

So yes, there is still work to be done to further develop Chinese typesetting on the web, and for all non-Latin-based languages actually. The Chinese Layout Task Force, which I am a part of, aims to document requirements for the layout and presentation of text for the major languages of China when they are used by Web standards, like Hanzi, Mongolian, Tibetan and Uighur scripts.

## On utilising vertical layouts

Implementing vertical layouts has become much easier, as browser vendors continue to improve the functionality of their products, and this opens up an aspect of graphic design that isn't often seen on the web at the moment.

For example, you can make a bookshelf style list of posts with just CSS. Something like this can be done by applying a vertical-rl to each list item, with some padding and inset box-shadows thrown in for the visual effect.

Or we could do headers. Normally we wouldn't think of laying out long chunks of text vertically for typical Latin-based left-to-right languages. But using vertical text for short titles or headers can break up the monotony of a long page.

Other subtle uses of vertical text could be for tags on blog posts for example, or wherever information is not critical to the main content, so laying it out vertically won't adversely affect the reading experience.

If you're working with a language meant to be read horizontally from top to bottom, then vertical text should largely be decorative. We don't want to compromise the reading experience for long form passages. So at smaller screens, we can make use of media queries to revert to a horizontal layout that makes better use of the limited space.

On the other hand, there are instances where text rotated vertically can work on narrow screen sizes as well. Like Joe explained yesterday, the hamburger menu is not a design axiom.

Depending on the number of links in your navigation, laying them out vertically along the side edge could be a design worth considering. And I'm sure many of you can come up with even more interesting designs that utilise vertical layouts.

Statistically, there aren't that many sites which use the writing-mode property. When I started building vertical layouts, Grid hadn't landed yet, so I used Flexbox for a lot of the layout. Flexbox support is great, I mean, it has wider coverage than border-radius, but Flexbox with writing-mode? Not so good. I'll be honest, there are quite a number of cross browser issues.

But that doesn't mean we should just shy away from using vertical text altogether. In fact, there's never been a better time than now to live on the cutting edge. Evergreen browsers are a thing now, with bug fixes and new features being shipped faster than ever.

And here's a little something I learned along the way. By raising bugs we find when trying out new features, we are actually telling browser vendors that these features are in demand.

Conversely, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and focus on something else instead. Because we all have to prioritise.

Raising bugs will probably gain you karma points and helps make the web better for all of us.

## Wrapping up

This is the long list of resources I referred to when preparing this talk, and these slides will be shared with anyone who's interested.

If you need inspiration for vertical layouts, the Tateyoko Web Awards site has a really nice list. While Jen Simmons has an experimental layout lab where she showcases all the different things that are now possible with modern CSS.

The thing about attending conferences, at least for me, is not so much to gain expertise overnight, but rather to get inspired. To learn of things that I did not know existed, to discover something new and perhaps gain insights and hear perspectives that never occurred to me before.

All these techniques I mentioned may or may not be relevant to you right now, and that's perfectly fine. But I do hope that you keep them at the back of your mind, so that one day, when the time comes, you can reach for them and create something extraordinary.

Thank you all for your attention.
