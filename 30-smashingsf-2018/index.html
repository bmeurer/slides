              <p>For me, I love the web. The World Wide Web. Last month, I read a book called “Weaving the Web”, which is the story of the World Wide Web, told by its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he mentioned that there was no ‘Eureka’ moment, no ‘an-apple-hit-me-on-the-head’ kind of event, when it came to inventing the web.</p>
              <p>For him, inventing the World Wide Web involved a growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike manner. An awareness that he developed through a process of accretion over the course of his life and experiences prior.</p>
              <p>Unlike computers, which are absolutely great at following step-by-step instructions, but fail terribly at making random associations, the human mind has a special ability to link random bits of information and connect seemingly unrelated ideas to generate new ones.</p>

              <p>Many of the technical decisions around the web arose because of the key idea of universality. The basic revelation that one information space could encompass all the different documentation systems out there, giving huge power and consistency.</p>
              <p>The ability to easily create a link from one document to another, across different organisations or institutions, without needing to merge databases or even have access to the other system. This was the premise the web was built upon.</p>

              <p>I was a lucky kid, in that even though our family was far from rich, we've always had a computer in the house. I think my parents needed one for work or something. But when I was yea tall, the only thing I was concerned about out of that beige box was what games I could play on it.</p>
              <p>Key functions of the computers from my childhood included, the 5.25 inch floppy drive, and the wonderfully clicky turbo button. I had no idea what it did at the time, but loved to press it anyway.</p>
              <p>And my first experience with the web sounded something like this. This is music to my ears. If you've never heard this before, well, you're obviously not from my generation. When I think about the web, I think about how amazing it is that it can connect the world's population.</p>
              <p>In fact, without the web, the odds of me even being here are rather slim. Without the web, the odds that we would have ever crossed paths are practically anorexic at best. And I would definitely not be standing up here, telling you this story about the web and reminiscing about my youth.</p>

              <p>I'm sure many people from America and Europe know exactly where Southeast Asia is. I mean, it's sort of self-explanatory, it's the South-Eastern section of Asia. But then again, I have also met people whose idea of Asia was limited to, China, India or Japan.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia is made up of 11 countries, and every single one of them has their own distinct culture. English is taught in schools across the region, but we have so many other languages as well.</p>

              <p>Southeast Asia was heavily colonised by European powers starting from the 16th century, with Thailand being the only territory that avoided that fate. After the second World War, many colonies fought for their right to be independent sovereign states. Independence is always a struggle, like the Chinese saying 万事开头难, that states every beginning is difficult.</p>
              <p>As nascent countries, which were also ex-European colonies, there was the inevitable self-deprecation, that somehow the Westerners were more powerful, and better at things. A mindset that still lingers a little to this day.</p>

            <h2>Do developers even care about typography?</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I got asked this question before, do developers even care about typography? At the time I thought this was a ridiculous question. In my mind, I was like, of course they do. But I'm wrong about a lot of things. So how many of you think typography is important?</p>
              <p>Typography has always been an integral part of Human-Computer Interaction and software design. Rendering text and graphics on an electronic screen is no easy task.</p>
              <p>If you really think about it, anything we see on a screen has everything to do with the field of computer graphics. And digital typography is really a cross-disciplinary field involving technical engineering, aesthetic design and mathematical precision.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Oliver Reichenstein said this in his article back in 2006. He reiterated that the web as a medium, is all about information.</p>
              <p>You might disagree with me, but as front-end developers, the code we write impacts how our sites or applications look, so we too have a share of the responsibility in the design of our products.</p>
              <p>Textual content is the most straightforward method of delivering information on the web. And whether we like it or not, Typography is increasingly becoming what differentiates a good website from bad.</p>
              <p>Let's be honest, people are superficial and have short attention spans these days. The typography, layout and design of a site or application are like the clothes you wear. And people make judgements off their first impressions of you or your site based on what they see.</p>

            <blockquote>“Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”<br><small>—Gerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">There are many definitions of Typography out there, and I personally like this one, by Gerrit Noordzij. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language. I believe there's a pretty diverse mix of languages spoken by the audience here today, and while a large number of those languages are alphabetic, Chinese is not one of them.</aside>

              <p>Chinese is a logographic writing system, where each character is composed within a uniform square. This allows Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese script developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

              <p>This is why the Western languages in Europe are inherently different from the Eastern languages in Asia. Alphabetic languages, which originated from the Phoenician alphabet, combine a small set of letters to form all the words that the language needs for the purpose of communication.</p>
              <p>Chinese characters, on the other hand, number in the tens of thousands. Each a unique glyph that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The appearance of the earliest letterforms was directly influenced by the tools that were used to create them, and continually evolved in tandem with the limitations of the technologies of their time.</p>
              <p>Take the Latin alphabet for example, which is derived from Greek. The earliest letters were sans-serif when writing was done with a hard reed pen. Serifs may have came about due to a transition to a square-cut writing implement, like a flat stiff brush.</p>
              <p>Later scribes and copyists used quill pens and as demand for written matter grew, they developed more efficient styles of writing, evolving the letterforms yet again.</p>

              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font clocks in at around 35,000 glyphs, give or take a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>Typefaces that have enough glyph coverage to be used in body copy are usually made by foundries as very few independent type designers have the bandwidth for that.</p>
