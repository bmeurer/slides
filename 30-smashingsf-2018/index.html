          <aside class="notes">Smashing has been around since 2006, and it has always been focused on the web. Offering practical resources for designers and developers to create and build for the web. So I would like to start off by asking everyone here, what does the web mean to you?</aside>

            <p>For me, I love the web. The World Wide Web. Last month, I read a book called “Weaving the Web”, which is the story of the World Wide Web, told by its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee. And he mentioned that there was no ‘Eureka’ moment, no ‘an-apple-hit-me-on-the-head’ kind of event, when it came to inventing the web.</p>
            <p>For him, inventing the World Wide Web involved a growing realisation that there was a power in arranging ideas in an unconstrained, weblike manner. An awareness that he developed through a process of accretion over the course of his life and experiences prior.</p>
            <p>Unlike computers, which are absolutely great at following step-by-step instructions, but fail terribly at making random associations, the human mind has a special ability to link random bits of information and connect seemingly unrelated ideas to generate new ones.</p>

            <p>I was a lucky kid, in that even though our family was far from rich, we've always had a computer in the house. I think my parents needed one for work or something. But when I was yea tall, the only thing I was concerned about out of that beige box was what games I could play on it.</p>
            <p>My first experience with the web sounded like this. If you've never heard this before, well, you're obviously not from my generation. When I think about the web, I think about how amazing it is that it can connect the world's population.</p>
            <p>In fact, without the web, the odds of me even being here are rather slim. Without the web, the odds that we would have ever crossed paths are practically anorexic at best. And I would definitely not be standing up here, telling you this story about the web.</p>

              <p>Has anybody watched Star Trek Discovery? Any fans of the show? So this beautiful woman is Michelle Yeoh, one of the greatest action stars of all time and the pride of Malaysians everywhere.</p>
              <p>When she first got to Hollywood, people were amazed that she could speak English so well. And she, in turn, was equally amazed that people in Hollywood had such a limited grasp of world geography, seeing as they did not know where Malaysia was.</p>

              <p>I'm sure many people from America and Europe know where Southeast Asia is. I mean, it's sort of self-explanatory, it's the South-Eastern section of Asia. But then again, I have also met people whose idea of Asia was limited to, China, India or Japan.</p>
              <p>Southeast Asia is made up of 11 countries, and every single one of them has their own distinct culture. English is taught in schools across the region, but we have so many other languages as well.</p>
