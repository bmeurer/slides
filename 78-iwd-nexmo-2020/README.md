# Women in Tech, anecdotes from Singapore

*For Nexmo's IWD event. This is sort of a transcript for the talk.*

Hello everyone! It is such a privilege to speak to all of you today, I'm really chuffed for this opportunity to share with you my experiences in the Singapore tech industry and how we too are doing our part to increase the diversity of this industry within Singapore and hopefully our surrounding regions as well.

I'm Hui Jing, and am a member of the Developer Relations team. I'm currently based in Singapore so it's about 6pm right now, and these emojis are a pretty good summary of me as a person.

My first job as a web developer was back in 2013 and I got more involved in the local tech community around 2015. To be honest, the gender imbalance was not something that was top of mind for me when I started out. The first 2 companies I worked for had more female developers than male ones. Something that I only realised later was not common at all.

Even though I identify as female, I generally don't dress femme. It's probably more hobo style than anything else, but I'm a T-shirt and basketball shorts kinda person. It's Singapore, tropical weather you know. I'm also taller than average, have short hair and am passably athletic. So when I show up for meetups, I literally blend right into the sea of dudes for the most part.

My perspective shifted one day and I can tell you exactly when.

I met Elisha Tan, who founded TechLadies as a community for women in Asia to connect, learn, and advance as programmers in the tech industry, way back in 2016 when she was launching this passion project of hers. She was looking for one more speaker for her panel and asked if I was interested.

I said yes and that was my first women in tech event ever. It was then, sitting in front of a sea of women for the first time at a tech event that I realised every tech meetup or event I had been to prior was almost entirely male. That was my cannot-unsee moment.

And since then, I **have** started to notice that there would only be a couple of women in a sea of men at events. I had since worked for teams where I was the only woman on the team. And I have yet to attend a tech conference where there have been more female speakers than male.

This is a good time to talk about Global Diversity CFP day. This initiative is a community event based on the successful workshops held in advance of ScotlandCSS and ScotlandJS 2016.

Before this became a thing on a global scale, we had something similar in conjunction with JSConf.Asia 2018. A workshop for folks who wanted to speak at conferences but didn't know how to get started. It was hosted by one of the local community organisers, Lu Wei, so when Global Diversity CFP day became a thing the following year, she hosted that too.

The workshop is ran slightly differently around the world, but the gist of things is we cover how you could craft your CFP, which is the call for proposals application that a number of tech conferences use to find and select speakers. How to write your bio, because it turns out a lot of folks find it challenging to write nice things about themselves.

For us, we like to have a panel discussion (as you can see from the photos) with members of the local community who have spoken at conferences before so they could share their experiences, their process, takeaways and so on.

Come 2019, she was unable to host because her pregnancy was due around that time, so she asked if I would take over, which I did. I was quite happy with how things turned out, nobody died, people said nice things to me, there was some food left over that fed me for a couple days after.

But the biggest highlight of that for me was that two of the participants went on to give their first international conference talks. Participants sounds so distant, Singapore is a tiny country. These folks are my friends.

I chatted with the lady on the left, Gao Wei, for the first time that day. She is now my best friend, and I was in the audience, sitting in the front row as she presented the keynote for Day 2 of JSConf China. I also paired up with the lady on the right, Chin Hwee, that day for the bio writing exercise. She had gone on to speak at 2 conferences later that year as well as other local meetups.

Honestly, there is no greater feeling than seeing people you care about doing amazing things.

We did the event again this year, and I'm very grateful to my team at Nexmo (now Vonage) for supporting me doing this event both last year and this year.

It's been a while since 2013 when I first started in the tech industry here in Singapore. Over the years, I've developed friendships with women in tech who have shared their experiences with harassment, with misogyny, about being gaslighted. Sometimes I don't know what's worse, if the perpetrators are aware they are doing it or if they are not.

We have a long way to go, but now I see a few more meetups hosted and run by women. And it might seem like a small thing to some people, but I feel this is significant because it shows that women are part of the tech community as well. There is space for us, and we want to make it a place worth staying.

The effort of women alone is insufficient though. We do need male allies who are willing to hold space for us, and take action when necessary. There have been instances when the code of conduct had been violated and our local tech community leaders have made it a point to take such violations very seriously and deal with them swiftly, even if it means banning someone from participating in community events.

Inaction is complicity, and it is heartening to know that our community leaders have set a strong example for the rest of the community.

Just to close off, I'd like to reiterate this year's theme of Each for Equal, a call to every single one of us to make an effort to challenge stereotypes, fight bias, broaden perceptions, improve situations and celebrate women's achievements. Our individual efforts may seem small, but collectively, they have the potential to bring about seismic changes.

Thank you all for your time and attention.
