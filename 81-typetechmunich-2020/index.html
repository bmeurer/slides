            <blockquote class="fragment">‚ÄúTypography is writing with prefabricated letters‚Äù<br><small>‚ÄîGerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Like I said, this is my first ever typography conference. But I think I was interested in typography before I even knew what it was. Or at least, what it was formally defined as. And I don't think there is a standardised definition, and each have their own nuances.</p>
              <p>Personally, I like the one by Gerrit Noordzij, that ‚ÄúTypography is writing with prefabricated letters‚Äù. Letters are a type of grapheme, which is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language.</p>
              <p>A large proportion of the world's writing systems in use today are alphabetic in nature, where a relatively small set of letters can be combined in many different ways to form words, phrases and sentences. Transforming something we hear and say, into something we see and read.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>But Chinese is different. Chinese is currently the only logographic writing system left that is widely used by millions of people. Each Han character is composed within a uniform square, allowing Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese language was an indigenous invention, developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The nature of writing systems for Western languages in Europe are fairly distinct from that used in East Asia. The Phoenician alphabet is considered the origin of many alphabetic writing systems on which the Greek, Latin and Roman alphabets were based on. With alphabets, you have a small set of letters used in a myriad of combinations to form all the words you would use to communicate with another person.</p>
              <p>With Han characters, we have thousands upon thousands of unique glyphs that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs. This has a direct consequence on the structure of the language itself.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Alphabetic languages form words using combinations of letters, sometimes we end up with really long words. Chinese is more concise, and often the meaning of the word is encompassed within the glyph itself. And that's how we ended up with tens of thousands of characters. But no matter the writing system, the end goal was always to express and record ideas into something concrete.</aside>

            cuneiform, hireoglyphs, brush
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Before we get into the talk proper, where we'll be looking at what current web technologies offer for typesetting in the browser, I'd like everyone to just give a think about information technology. Since we are often said to be living in the information age right now.</p>
              <p>Information technology deals with the storage and retrieval of information, the extraction of higher levels of meaning from a collection of information and the transmission of information over large distances.</p>
              <p>Writing is the first information technology humans ever developed. And writing was so flexible. All you needed was a surface and an implement to create marks on that surface. Vincent Steer, founder of the British Typographers' Guild, had said that the character of any alphabet is dictated by the materials used in its expression.</p>
              <p>Cuneiform writing was made by using a wedge-shaped tool that was pressed into wet clay, the Egyptians wrote on papyrus with a reed pen, making their lines were soft and flowy. Chinese writing centred around the brush, and this too informed how Han characters evolved over time.</p>

            printing, lithograph, keyboard configurations
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Technological advancement can generally be thought of as humanity's solution for producing more output for less effort. The advancement of information technology sought to reproduce writing at scale, from employing larger number of humans to copy scripts to the development of printing and digital technology.</p>
              <p>But with every increase in productivity, significant trade-offs were made. The techniques that won out over the course of human civilisation shape how we live today. There are a huge number of factors that came into play but what is undeniable is that modern day digital technology suits a particular style of writing system over others.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what an alternate history would look like because my reality is here and now. It's as if you're asking a person who has been colour-blind their whole life to imagine what green is. Science fiction writers probably do a better job of this, but I do wonder how different our lives would be if digital technology was pioneered in a different region.</p>

              <p>Different font formats store information about the font, like their glyphs, encodings, metadata about the font and so on, differently based on how their specifications were written.</p>

              <p>Digital content is stored as a series of binary numeric values, or bytes. There has to be a form of translation performed by the computer before characters can be rendered on the screen as characters that we can recognise and read. Sequences of bytes are mapped to individual characters according to a key, which is known as character encoding.</p>
              <p>The first encoding standard was the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), which was originally based on the English alphabet and developed from telegraph code, specifically Baudot code, if anybody is interested in history.</p>
              <p>Computer architecture at the time was largely 8-bit, while ASCII encoded characters in 7 bits, for the original 128 characters. There was capacity for another 128 characters and when computers reached countries outside America, everyone did their own thing to cater for their own language and character requirements.</p>

              <p>As mentioned earlier, writing systems utilising Han characters consist of tens of thousands of glyphs. These were never going to fit into 8 bits. Local encoding systems like the Chinese Guobiao and the Taiwanese Big5 were developed to handle Chinese characters.</p>
              <p>Japan even created multiple systems for Japanese depending on the hardware, but the systems were not compatible with one another. The Japanese even have a term for the garbled output caused by text decoded with an unintended chracter encoding, called Mojibake (ÊñáÂ≠óÂåñ„Åë).</p>
              <p>This issue is less pronounced today with the widespread adoption of Unicode, but it is not solved. For example, Burmese text sometimes still doesn't display correctly on Facebook.</p>

              <p>Unicode is the ambitious effort to create a single universal character set that encompasses every reasonable writing system on the planet. Even though it is also a mapping of bits to characters, it is a multi-byte variable-width encoding. If a character can be represented with 1 byte, it will use 1 byte, but if it needs 4 bytes, that's what it will get.</p>
              <p>A Unicode plane is a continuous group of 65,536 code points. There are 17 planes in the Unicode standard and as of version 12.1, six of the planes have assigned code points. So there is plenty of room left.</p>
              <p>The first plane, plan 0, is the Basic Multilingual Plane and contains the characters for almost all modern languages. Most of the assigned code points in this plane are used for Chinese, Japanese or Korean (CJK) characters and East Asian scripts.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Every computer's operating system has a text rendering engine, which is responsible for rasterising the font outlines for display on the screen. Browsers' layout engines will defer to the operating system's text rendering engine. If there are multiple text rendering engines, the browser can pick which to use. This is why text looks different on Mac and Windows, and sometimes even vary on different browsers on the same machine.</p>
              <p>Electronic displays these days are fairly high resolution, but a huge majority of the screens we encounter are raster displays. Which means everything we see on screens are made up of individual discrete pixels. We've just managed to pack a lot more pixels onto a screen than we used to.</p>

            <h2>Chinese typeface design</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Designing Chinese characters is significantly more challenging as compared to Latin-based alphabets or Arabic numerals for a number of reasons. Firstly, the sheer volume of glyphs required for just for daily use alone is around 7000, but there are more than 50000 in existence.</p>
              <p>Such a monumental task, if undertaken by a single experienced designer working full time would probably take at least 3 years to complete the 6763 characters defined in the Chinese national standard. Most foundries employ a team working closely together over 3 to 5 months. However, this also increases the risk of inconsistency in structure and style across such a large volume of characters.</p>
              <p>The structure of Chinese characters are also more complex, often having more than 10 strokes and intersection points. Quite a challenge from a rendering perspective as well.</p>

            <h2>Typographic anti-aliasing</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Joel Spolsky pointed out that Apple and Microsoft have differing philosophies on how fonts ought to be displayed on computer screens. Even though both use sub-pixel rendering to sharpen fonts on lower resolution screens, the major philosophical difference is that Apple believes the goal of the algorithm is to preserve the design of the typeface as much as possible, as the expense of sharpness, while Microsoft generally believes the shape of each letter should be fitted into pixel boundaries to prevent blurriness and improve readability, at the expense of the typeface's original design.</p>
              <p>As such, both operating systems Tim Brown's series about type rendering on the web demonstrates this difference in a collection of screenshots of text being rendered by these different engines with and without the different anti-aliasing techniques applied.</p>

              <p>I thought this was worth a mention because even though this is not a standard property (it was in the specification in 2002 but removed in the next release). Because it is not standard, the properties are vendor-prefixed, and only apply to Mac OS X and macOS.</p>
              <p>By default, the Webkit engine typically uses subpixel anti-aliasing when it is available. This property allows you to turn off subpixel rendering in favour of a standard anti-aliasing technique for font smoothing, which uses whole pixels to render the font.</p>
              <p>Doing so makes the fonts look thinner and in some contexts sharper, but because there are also cases where doing so will make the text appear more blurry, opinions are mixed on whether this should be used throughout an entire web page or not.</p>
              <p>For stroke-dense Han characters, the phenomena might be even more pronounced, so just something to think about.</p>

              <p>Most CJK system fonts have very good coverage, coming in between 20,000 to 30,000 glyphs. When web fonts were introduced, it allowed developers to send fonts that were not installed on their users' systems via a URL. Font data does take up bandwidth though, and font sizes are dependent on the size of the character set supported by the font.</p>
              <p>You might glean where I'm going with this. The nature of CJK fonts make them impractical from a performance standpoint as web fonts delivered over the internet. This is why most sites will use system fonts for body copy and sparing use of custom fonts for very limited character sets.</p>
