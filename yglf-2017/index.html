    <title>When East meets West: web typography and how it can inspire modern layouts</title>
    <meta name="description" content="This talk traces the parallel history of western and eastern typography from handwriting to the internet age, setting the context for how the web is a brand new medium for typesetting. CSS allows us to implement advanced typographic features and multi-directional layouts, that not only benefits internationalisation, but opens up a myriad of options for creative and interesting layouts in general as well.">

              <p>The purpose of the web is to connect the world's population, allowing people who live half a planet away to become friends. To share your experiences with people 20km or 20,000km away from you. To provide a means of communication, and most importantly, for people to gain access to information and even employment.</p>

Each Chinese character is composed within a uniform square, allowing Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically.</p>
              <p>And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese script developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</p>

              <p>If you've ever used web fonts before, you would have seen these font formats. Fonts are containers for glyphs, and font formats describe these glyphs. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which were fine for low-resolution screens, but for printing on high-resolution printers, a better solution was needed.</p>
              <p>It was such a worthy problem that smart people came up with two different solutions. Donald Knuth created Metafont in 1978 for the TeX system, which generated compressed bitmap fonts. John Warnock, founder of Adobe, came up with Postscript in 1985, which was the very first vector font.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Both companies then worked separately to improve TrueType, especially with regards to fonts for East Asian writing systems. And Apple came up with TrueType GX, later renamed Apple Advanced Typography, while Microsoft turned to Adobe and together they came up with OpenType.</p>
              <p>EOT, or embedded OpenType is Microsoft's proprietary standard, which is a compact form of OpenType fonts meant for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF was quite the industry effort, involving Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera.</p>

              <p>Not counting the font shorthand, there are six basic font properties. The first four have been around for quite a bit, while the last two were added in Fonts Level 3.</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>font-weight</code> is for indicating the stroke thickness of your font, and can take values from <code>100</code> to <code>900</code> or keywords, like <code>bolder</code> or <code>lighter</code>.</li>
                <li><code>font-stretch</code> is used to select fonts based on their widths, ranging from condensed to expanded. <code>font-style</code> allows for the selection of italic or oblique faces. Italics are cursive, but obliques are sloped versions of a regular face.</li>
                <li><code>font-size</code> indicates the desired height of the glyphs, and we can use absolute values like pixels and ems or relative values like percentages or viewport units, as well as keywords like <code>larger</code> or <code>smaller</code>.</li>
                <li><code>font-size-adjust</code> was put in to address legibility issues. Faces with low x-heights may sometimes be less legible, especially when they are triggered as fallback fonts. We can set the value of this property to the aspect ratio of the first choice font. Any fallback fonts triggered will have their font-size adjusted to match this ratio.</li>
                <li><code>font-synthesis</code> is also new, and was put in to address the issue of faux bolds and faux italics. Sometimes the true italic or heavier version of a font does not exist so the browser will try to compensate. Unfortunately, the end result isn't pretty. With this property, you can set a value of <code>none</code>, to tell the browser, it's fine buddy, appreciate the effort, but no thanks.</li>

            <p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows us to link to fonts, either locally or external, which are fetched and activated when needed.</p>
            <p>We can use multiple <code>@font-face</code> rules to construct font families.</p>
            <p>A rule consists of the <code>@font-face</code> keyword followed by a block of font descriptors.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows us to use fonts beyond those available on a given platform by linking to those font files, which could be locally available or from an external source. Each rule specifies the characteristics of a single font within a family.</p>
              <p>These fonts will only be loaded when required. Multiple <code>@font-face</code> rules can be used to build an entire font family. And it consists of the <code>@font-face</code> keyword plus a bunch of font descriptors. Font descriptors and CSS properties are not the same thing.</p>

              <p>This is how an <code>@font-face</code> rule looks like. I don't think most people read through the CSS specification like they would a novel, so it's perfectly fine if this looks excessively complicated to you. Of all these descriptors, only the <code>font-family</code> descriptor and the <code>src</code> descriptor are mandatory.</p>
              <p>If either of them are absent, the entire rule is ignored. Now the <code>font-family</code> descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So even if you're using say, Frutiger, you could actually label it “Kreplach” and it would still work.</p>
              <p>The <code>src</code> descriptor is comma-separated list of external references or locally-installed font face names. It is made up of the declaration of the font file's location, and an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, the font file won't be loaded.</p>
              <p>The next 3 descriptors, for style, weight and stretch, are used to match styles to a particular typeface in later declarations. Again, they are descriptors, so technically you could assign a black typeface to a font-weight of 100 and proceed to confuse your team members who cannot figure out why setting a weight of 100 gives them this massively bold typeface. Please don't do that.</p>
              <p>Every Unicode character is represented by a unique code point. The <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor allows us to specify individual code points or a range of code points for characters we want displayed using a particular font face. We can make use of this to create custom font families with glyphs from different typefaces.</p>

              <p>Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. OpenType and Apple Advanced Typography are what we term modern font technologies, and they can contain a lot more glyphs that previous font formats.</p>
              <p>So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on. The original <code>font-variant</code> property that could only be used to trigger small-caps was also expanded, a great deal. Because there are so many properties available, each with lots of values, I'm just going to do a general overview. Some of you may be wondering, what's the point of having all these typographic features?</p>
              <p>They are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.</p>
              <p>So these are the features you can turn on via CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Few people talk about <code>font-variant-east-asian</code>. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. If you're unfamiliar with Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs, but it depends. Han unification involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.</p>
              <p>We won't get into that, but the point is, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese glyphs have their own specification known as JIS or Japanese Industrial Standard, and they too have alternate glyphs for the same character. This property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Now the <code>font-language-override</code> property controls the rendering of language-specific glyphs in the typeface used. A commonly raised use-case is the use of common ligatures, for the fi combination. The Turkish alphabet has both a dotted and dotless i, so the fi ligature shouldn't be used. Maybe a typeface doesn't recognise a lesser-known language like the Azeri language, which similar to Turkish, too has the dotless i, the <code>font-language-override</code> property can be used to force the usage of Turkish glyphs instead.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code> allows us to toggle very specific OpenType properties. Last I checked, there were 141 OpenType feature tags to cover things like vertical kerning, unicase, scientific inferiors and so on.</p>
              <p>Browser support for each of <code>font-variant</code> properties varies at the moment, with Firefox being the only browser that has supported all of them since version 34.0.</p>
              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code>, on the other hand, has quite good support across most browsers. Although, the specification recommends to utilise the respective <code>font-variant</code> properties over the <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, ntil browser support becomes more robust, I suppose we'll continue to see <code>font-feature-settings</code> being used instead.</p>

              <p>But at the end of the day, we still need to keep in mind that CJK fonts weigh in on a megabyte scale. The font hosting services do offer optimisations like lazy loading and dynamic subsetting, so hopefully that helps. If you want to serve your own fonts, there are also tools available to help reduce the size of your font files.</p>
              <p>If I'm building a non-Chinese site, I always turn to Font Squirrel to generate my webfonts, because subsetting. Font Squirrel's web font generator allows for a very granular level of customisation that I haven't found in other tools. There is a desktop application for Mac called FontPrep, which does subsetting quite well too.</p>
              <p>Font Spider is an open-source command line tool that does smart webfont compression and conversion. It offers the ability to subset fonts based on the glyphs being used on your site. Interestingly, all these services seem to be rather fond of using animals for branding.</p>
              <p>But if you're really concerned about speed and page weight, you can simply choose not to use any webfonts at all, because honestly, I think that system fonts shipped with the newer OSes are getting much better.</p>
              <p>I personally use a hybrid technique, where the body text is set in a system font, but for the big titles and display text, where there is a limited number of characters I know will not change much over time, I generate webfonts containing only those glyphs, which makes the font file much much smaller than the full character set.</p>

              <p>But when we got to the pre-teen era, things started to conform a little more. We got a bit more self-concious, a little less radical, it wasn't that cool to be different. Float-based layouts to build sites with headers, sidebars and footers were the most socially acceptable.</p>
              <p>By high school, life had gotten complicated, and angsty. CSS was hard. Responsive design, what? People suck. Browsers are broken. Oh, someone will do all that for me? Frameworks? Sure! I don't give a crap.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>But something big happened this year. CSS Grid was released. CSS Grid is a revolutionary feature that was designed specifically for doing layout on the web.</p>
              <p>All the other techniques we've used in the past, HTML tables, floats, even flexbox, were never meant for doing full page layouts. They were creative hacks we came up with to build the layouts that we wanted.</p>
              <p>So this is the year web layouts come of age. CSS grid gives us a level of control over how elements are rendered on the browser that we've never had before.</p>

            <h2>The magic of Writing Modes</h2>
            <p>CSS Writing Modes Level 3 defines CSS features to support for various international writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. Latin or Indic), right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew or Arabic), bidirectional (e.g. mixed Latin and Arabic) and vertical (e.g. Asian scripts).</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>There is an entire specification dedicated to writing modes and it's defined as such, support for international writing systems. So coverage includes right-to-left languages as well, but the <code>writing-mode</code> property specifically addresses vertical writing.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Let's cover some basic terminology. First up, inline base direction, which is that blue arrow there. It is the direction that content is ordered on a line, and defines where the line starts and ends. The green arrow indicates block flow direction, which is the direction block-level boxes stack and the direction of this stacking within their container. The <code>writing-mode</code> property dictates the block flow direction. What you see here is the standard default value of horizontal-tb.</aside>

              <p>This is when we apply <code>vertical-lr</code> and <code>vertical-rl</code> respectively. The block flow direction is now horizontal, while the inline base direction is vertical. And then there's the orientation of the individual glyphs.</p>
              <p>Every writing system has one or more native orientations. For example, Latin scripts and Arabic scripts are horizontal only, Mongolian is vertical only, and Han and Japanese Kana are bi-orientational. All glyphs are assigned a horizontal orientation by default, and the User Agent needs to transform text from this horizontal default when laying out text vertically.</p>

              <p>One more property is text-combine-upright. This addresses the issue of numerals and abbreviations in vertical text. A very common use case is dates, especially for Taiwan, where they use the 民國 calendar. This property lets us fit all the digits into the width of one character and display them upright.</p>
              <p>No browser supports the digits value yet, which allows us to dictate how many digits are acceptable to be squeezed in. The range allowed is between 2 to 4 characters. For now, with the <code>all</code> value, there is no limit, so you could technically put hippopotamus in there and it will just look horribly squished.</p>

          <aside class="notes">As I mentioned earlier, 25-35 characters per line is a reasonable length, and that's done by clamping the height of the content block. Because Chinese characters are squares, that also implies that in normal circumstances, a height of 25 ems gives you 25 characters per line. To vertically centre the content block, we can actually set the top and bottom margins to <code>auto</code>, something we wished we could do but couldn't for horizontal writing. But trying to centre things horizontally is equally painful, if not more, for vertical writing.</aside>

He was born in Rotterdam, where he grew up in an impoverished household and attended the Rotterdam Academy, training in fine and commercial arts. In 1926, the adventurous young artist stowed away on a ship bound for Argentina. While the ship was docked in Virginia, de Kooning slipped off, skirted immigration, and made his way to New Jersey—and so began the rest of his life.</p>

Flexbox support is great, I mean, it has wider coverage than <code>border-radius</code>, but Flexbox with <code>writing-mode</code>? Not so good. I'll be honest, there are quite a large number of cross browser issues.

            <p>This works both ways, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and choose to fix more pressing bugs instead. But if more of us use those features and raise the bugs we discover, it sends a signal to browser vendors that people are using these features and encourage them to address related bugs sooner than later.</p>

            <p>If you need inspiration for vertical layouts, the Tateyoko Web Awards site has really nice list. My friend, Jen Simmons, also has an experimental layout lab where she showcases all the different things that are now possible with modern CSS.</p>
            <p>And even if you don't end up using any of what I've covered immediately in your next project, I hope that you keep these techniques and properties in the back of your mind. And maybe one day, when you're tired of building the same old layouts again and again, you'll reach for them and create something amazing.</p>
