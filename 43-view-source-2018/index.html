            <p>Bruce Lee was the most impactful martial artist of this generation. His legendary fighting prowess translated well onto the silver screen, where he became an iconic kung-fu superstar.</p>
            <p>But he was also a deeply self-reflective man, who developed profound philosophical insights about the world around him and life itself.</p>

            <p>Bruce Lee was a student of both Western and Eastern philosophy. And drew inspiration from the Taoist principles of 老子, recorded in the Chinese classic 道德经. A remarkably timeless publication, given it was authored during the 4th century BC.</p>
            <p>Water is a key metaphor in Taoist philosophy, and it can also be applied to the web.</p>

            <p>People access information on the web predominantly through browsers. And we do have a lot of them. But they are powered largely by four main layout engines, Blink by Google, Gecko by Mozilla, EdgeHTML by Microsoft and Webkit by Apple.</p>
            <p>With the maturation of web standards, browser behaviour is less unpredictable than before, though each browser still has their quirks. Features aren't all supported at the same time. But you know what? That's perfectly fine. If we accept this as a feature of the web, instead of a bug, we've just opened up a lot more web design possibilities.</p>

            <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-featurequeries"><img class="plain" data-src="img/caniuse-feature-queries.jpg"></a>
          </p>
          <aside class="notes">Feature queries are key to making this approach feasible. And support for it is really good, with coverage in over 90% of browsers, including Opera Mini. The only browsers that don't support it are Internet Explorer and Blackberry Mobile.</aside>

        <section>

  /* Styles that are supported in old browsers */
}

@supports (property:value) {
  .selector {
    /* Styles for browsers that support the specified property */
  }
}</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>And this is how a feature query looks like. It's a conditional that checks if the browser supports a particular property or not. If it doesn't, the entire block within the <code>@supports</code> rule is ignored.</p>
            <p>This means we start off with the basic layout that works everywhere. It could be a float-based layout, or even single column, maybe largely browser default UI elements, that sort of thing. Then we layer on styles based on the features we want to use.</p>
            <p>By organising our code in this manner, the browsers that do not support feature queries or the specified property still get styled, while those that do get a different look. We're making use of the ‘C’ in CSS. Call it ‘Cascading Web Design’. If this concept ever takes off, remember you heard it here first.</p>

            <p>And yes, this approach does require a level of familiarity with CSS, but it's not rocket science. It boils down to experience, and the willingness to embrace CSS for what it is. With that in mind, let's talk about what we can use for web layouts.</p>

            <p>Layout is a pretty big part of web design. But when CSS was first introduced, it wasn't meant for doing layout. Fast-forward to today, we are at a point where we can almost match what is possible in print.</p>
            <p>However, we need to keep in mind that the web is a different medium from print. Just like there are some things print can do that the web can't, there are numerous things the web can do that print can't either.</p>
            <p>Often, with CSS, there are multiple ways to achieve the same effect, however, the amount of effort required depends on whether we chose the right tool for the job.</p>

            <p>There was an article titled ‘The Critical Request‘ that was published on CSS Tricks last month. It's a really good article on page performance, but what caught my eye was this beautifully designed header. It was an image on the actual article, but I felt it was something that definitely could be “web-ified”.</p>
            <p>So on a narrow screen, diagonals may not be a good idea, but once we have enough space, why not? Again, for browsers that don't support Transforms, we can still present a layout that doesn't use those properties with the help of feature queries. Remember, things on the web don't need to look the same all the time.</p>

            <p>With 3D transforms, we are operating with one more axis, which is the z-axis, for depth. So there are some additional properties like <code>backface-visibility</code> and <code>perspective</code>, for example. The <code>perspective</code> property controls how far an element appears to recede into the horizon. The smaller the value, the more dramatic the 3D effect is.</p>
            <p>So if I change the value of <code>perspective</code> here to something smaller, you can see that the horizon recedes much further away.</p>

            <p>But vertical alignment required a lot of workarounds, a lot of hacks and frustration. Luckily, CSS is not a fixed technology. Changes were introduced, improvements were made, and now we have a suite of tools for two-dimensional alignment and layout.</p>

            <p>Flexbox is short for flexible box, and it was conceived as a powerful tool for the distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps and complex websites often need. Yes, I quoted from the specification.</p>

            <p>When it comes to flex children, the key property is <code>flex</code>. It is strongly recommended that we use the <code>flex</code> shorthand rather than each of the individual long-hand properties. First value for amount of growth, second value for amount of shrinkage and last value being the starting width before free space is distributed.</p>
            <p><code>flex</code> comes with some handy keyword values for commonly desired effects, as shown in this table. If we don't set the flex value on a flex child, its default behaviour is cannot grow, will shrink.</p>

            <p>Because flex formatting contexts can operate in both dimensions, the auto-margins technique makes centring components much less painful. </p>
            <p>Any positive free space will be distributed to auto margins in their respective dimensions. So if I set a <code>margin-left: auto</code>, Boxie ends up all the way on the other end of the container. And if I do a <code>margin-top: auto</code>, Boxie gets sent all the way down.</p>
            <p>If we don't specify a dimension, then any free space will be equally distributed on either side of the flex item. And I love showing this example to people who have just started out with CSS and ran into a wall when it comes to centring items.</p>
            <p>Set a <code>margin: auto</code> and boom, 1-line solution to all your centring problems. Caveat, works best if you have only 1 flex child.</p>

              <p>Here, I have a list of images. Once I apply <code>display: flex</code>, all the items are shrunk and laid out in a single row. If I turn on wrap, they all revert to their original size because now there is no limit to how much space they need to take up, if there is no space, the image will just drop down to the next row, the next flex line.</p>
              <p>I'll turn on the border so you can see how each flex child behaves. Now instead of the initial behaviour of can shrink don't grow, I'll change it to can grow don't shrink and make the images take up the width of the child container. Now, there are a lot of options we can play with in terms of designing the whole layout.</p>
              <p>I can do an <code>align-items: center</code> and create this jagged look, which we don't see all that often on the web. Sometimes I find neat grids a bit monotonous. But if I have to, we can do that by standardising the height of the flex children. This makes the aspect ratio screwed up, so a compromise could be cropping off the taller images with the <code>object-fit</code> property.</p>

              <p>I can also change the direction of the layout by setting <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> and giving the container a defined height. Now I've got this horizontal scroll going on.</p>
              <p>And we can play around with the alignment of the items. Now that the flex direction has changed, the block and inline axes has also changed. <code>justify-content</code> shifts along the vertical axis, while <code>align-items</code> shifts along the horizontal axis.</p>
              <p>Maybe this new-age hipster layout isn't everyone's thing, that's fine. Remove the alignment code, make the flex children totally flexible and images fill up their containers' heights. <code>calc()</code> is an indispensable function I use when creating layouts. Here, <code>calc()</code> let's me account for the margins of each image with respect to their container heights. I can fix the widths of the images to get something like this.</p>
              <p>And these layouts are a demonstration of what Flexbox can do out-of-the-box. They are not hacks. These are native options that we have when it comes to designing our layouts.</p>
