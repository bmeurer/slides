            <p>But enough about me. Today, we're going to talk about Bruce Lee. Now, I see some sceptical faces. Some of you might be thinking, what does Bruce Lee have to do with web design? Maybe some of you never even heard of Bruce Lee.</p>
            <p>Bruce Lee was the most impactful martial artist of this generation. His legendary fighting prowess translated well onto the silver screen, where he became an iconic kung-fu superstar.</p>
            <p>But he was also a deeply self-reflective man, who developed profound philosophical insights about the world around him and life itself.</p>

            <p>Bruce Lee was a student of both Western and Eastern philosophy. And drew inspiration from the Taoist principles of 老子, recorded in the Chinese classic 道德经. A remarkably timeless publication, given it was authored during the 4th century BC.</p>
            <p>Water is a key metaphor in Taoist philosophy, and it can also be applied to the web.</p>

            <p>Content on the web behaves just like water. Rather than trying to wrangle every pixel into place, we need embrace the fact that content is meant to flow. When you freeze water into ice, it can no longer flow into containers of different shapes and sizes.</p>
            <p>Content that is fixed can only look good on specific screens. Also, if I throw a ball of ice at you, it's gonna hurt.</p>

            <p>Have you ever wondered why humans managed to take over the planet? A theory put forth by historian, Professor Yuval Noah Harari, credits our unique ability to talk about things that only exist in our own imagination. The ability to tell stories.</p>
            <p>Writing has enabled humans to organise entire societies, allowing us to experience reality through the mediation of abstract symbols. For thousands of years, information dissemination was done through physical media, things we can feel and touch.</p>

            <p>But when the first electronic computers came about in the 1940s, and screens started being used as output devices in the 50s, everything changed.</p>
            <p>An electronic display is a proxy medium, because whatever we see displayed on a screen comes from data encoded as electronic signals. The heart of electronic displays is light. It is transient. We cannot touch light.</p>

            <p>Designing for the web requires an intimate knowledge of the browser that will be rendering the final output. You can’t stick your hands in there and change things directly.</p>
            <p>You have to change the instructions given to the browser, explaining how you would like things to be rendered instead.</p>

            <p>The web has changed and evolved over the past 3 decades, as have I. I wasn't very useful in my early days. Couldn't walk, couldn't understand most instructions. Did whatever I felt like doing. Sort of like how browsers were back in the day, huh?</p>
            <p>But as the years passed, browser capabilities advanced. Mine did too. I could run, throw a ball, even drive a car. Evidently, I can now understand much more complicated instructions than before.</p>
            <p>Modern CSS gives us a wider vocabulary with which to communicate with the browser, so we can leverage these new capabilities that browsers now have for better art direction, more creative layouts and fresher designs that break out of the cookie cutter moulds we're so used to seeing on the web.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Layout is a pretty big part of web design. And we now have the tools to build layouts that suit the dynamic nature of the web. Flexbox is short for flexible box, and it was conceived as a powerful tool for the distributing space and aligning content in ways that web apps and complex websites often need. Yes, I quoted from the specification.</p>

          <aside class="notes">If we choose to learn a framework, and learn it well, all we get is the ability to manoeuvre within the bounds of the framework.

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Bruce Lee had put forth a criticism of martial arts masters who build up an illusion of fixed forms, who attempt to solidify the ever flowing. He called such practitioners insensitised patternised robots who merely perform methodical routines as responses rather than responding to “what is”.</p>
            <p>Perhaps we too, should allow our web designs to respond to “what is”. Perhaps we should be coming up with designs that “listen” to the circumstances of the different browsers that render them.</p>
