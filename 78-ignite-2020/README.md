# Talk.CSS, 4 years and counting

*For Microsoft Ignite Singapore 2020 (Humans of IT). This is sort of a transcript for the talk.*

So today I'll be sharing about a small community group that I've been heavily involved in for more than 4 years. This group is part of the much larger Singapore tech community but given how small Singapore is (like literally), let's just say, most of us know each other and overlap communities anyway.

As you can see from the title slide, I'm going to be talking about Talk.CSS. Talk is a common English word. I checked the dictionary and it means “speak in order to give information or express ideas or feelings; converse or communicate by spoken words”. But CSS is not a common English word.

What is CSS? For the benefit of anyone who is not familiar with web development, CSS is an acronym for Cascading Stylesheets. Stylesheets are used describe the presentation of a web page by telling the browser how elements on the page ought to be styled and laid out.

It is a stylesheet language, which has its own syntax and rules. As with any community made up of humans, everyone has their own opinion, and that's okay, it's a normal human thing. But naturally, there are also people who have “Opinions”, with a capital O. And some of them have such Opinions about CSS.

There is a sizeable portion of developers out there who regard CSS as inferior, a necessary evil that is not “real programming”, whatever that definition is. The thing about CSS is it FEELS easy at first glance. It's just a bunch of rules, how hard can it be? So it's not surprising that people who jump in expecting things to work a certain way end up angry at CSS when their expectations are not met.

If the world of programming was like high school, CSS would be probably be the nerdy artsy kid who gets bullied a lot, but is oh-so-talented at drawing and stuff. Okay, maybe that was a bad analogy. But that was just a long-winded way to explain that CSS is not exactly winning any popularity contests at large.
