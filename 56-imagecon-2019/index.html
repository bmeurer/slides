    <meta name="description" content="Images are often seen as the low-hanging fruit for performance optimisation on the web, so there's plenty of guidance around what image formats to use for which scenarios. But have you wondered why that is? Or how image data itself is interpreted by browsers? This talk goes down a rabbit hole in an attempt to uncover what goes on under the hood when it comes to rendering images on the web. And a deeper understanding of not only the how, but the why, can help you make more informed decisions about the images in your projects.">

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Hello! I'm pretty excited to be here, sharing the stage with so many amazing speakers. So thank you to the organisers for bringing me out. Today, I'd like to share with everyone my journey of trying to figure out images on the web. You see, I have this tendency to go down rabbit holes with things that seem rather straight-forward at first, but then, you get this little inkling that there's something more beneath the surface?</p>
            <p>Yeah, that's me. And images. I'm also very annoying and have an incessant need to ask why. Constantly. Which is why I love and appreciate everyone who is still willing to be friends with me. I've been working on the web for a number of years now, and I learned that image optimisation is one of the low-hanging fruits when it comes to web performance.</p>

        <section data-background-image="img/page-weight.svg" data-background-size="contain">
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>You may not be able to discern the exact numbers from this chart but know that as page weight has steadily crept up over the years, images on average make up more than 60% of that page weight.</p>
            <p>Image sizes matter, because sending smaller images of comparable quality to your users over the interwebs is not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do. But images are not all equal, some image formats are better suited for certain purposes over others. JPGs for photographs, choose PNGs over GIFs, don't use BMPs or TIFFs at all. I know all this. But for quite a while, I didn't know why, and it gnawed at me enough that one day I decided to find out.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Right, so images. Image making seems to be emblematic of humanity, don't you think? I tried to research if any other species creates images, and it seems that to date, no image making has ever appeared in the careers of primate artists, who would be the most logical next candidate besides human beings to ever do something like that.</aside>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Let's talk a bit about prehistoric images. I told you this was a rabbit hole, no? The earliest images date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, and some research has proposed that image making originated in the discovery of the representational capacity of lines, marks or blots of colour.</p>
            <p>And the act of imagemaking seemed culturally agnostic. From Namibia to Tanzania, India to Brazil and Australia, prehistoric humans were attempting to reproduce the three-dimensional, full-colour world they lived in by making marks on the surfaces around them.</p>
            <p>If you think about it, imagemaking was an analogue process for the longest time. A pigment on a surface. Something physical, something you could touch.</p>

            <p>Computers have come a long way in a relatively short period of less than a hundred years. The earliest of them having displays that were more indicators of device health rather than program output. But those panels of light bulbs, which allowed engineers to monitor the internal state of their machine, came to be known as a <em>monitor</em>.</p>
            <p>The binary nature of digital computing, pioneered by Konrad Zuse back in 1941, made it easier to represent data and perform calculations and logical operations, given you only had 2 states to deal with. This also made the machines easier to build and improved reliability.</p>

          <aside class="notes">Electronic displays actually pre-date digital computers, with the Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) becoming commercially available back in 1922. They worked by firing a beam of electrons onto a phosphor-coated screen. The energy from these electrons gets absorbed by the phosphor atoms, and kicks them up to higher energy levels.</aside>

          </figure>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>If you remember some high school physics, you may already know that this high energy state is unsustainable and the phosphor atoms will come back down, releasing the extra energy in the form of light, resulting in a bright spot on the screen.</p>
            <p></p>Images get displayed on the screen via a raster scan, where the electron beam is swept across the screen one row and a time from top to bottom. You could do something called a random scan which could generate vector graphics, but it was comparatively more expensive. Varying beam intensity allows for a pattern of illuminated spots across the screen and each of these screen points is a single pixel.</p>
            <p>Of course this is merely the mechanics of how an image gets displayed onto a screen, but what the image makes up, the data that describes this image has to come from somewhere.</p>
