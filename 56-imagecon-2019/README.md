# A deep dive into images on the web

*For ImageCon 2019. This is sort of a transcript of the talk.*

Hello! I'm pretty excited to be here today to share with everyone my journey of trying to figure out images on the web. You see, I have this tendency to go down rabbit holes with things that seem rather straight-forward at first, but then, you get this little inkling that there's something more beneath the surface?

Yeah, that's me. And images. I'm also very annoying and love asking the question why, which is why I love and appreciate everyone who is still willing to be friends with me. I've been working on the web for a number of years now, and I know that image optimisation is one of the low-hanging fruit when it comes to web performance.

That sending a smaller image of comparable quality across the interwebs to your users is the responsible thing to do. I know that. But for a while, I didn't know why, and it gnawed at me enough that one day I decided to find out.

My name is Hui Jing, you can also call me Jing. This is me in emojis, make what you will of them. The fox is not that obvious, but I use it to indicate that I'm a Mozilla Techspeaker, an initiative by Mozilla to support technical evangelists in regional communities around the world by providing resources and funding.

I also have a day job as a Developer Advocate with Nexmo. Nexmo being a platform that provides APIs for messenging, voice and authentication so developers can easily integrate communications into their applications.

Right, so images. Image making seems to be emblematic of humanity, don't you think? I tried to research if any other species creates images, and it seems that to date, no image making has ever appeared in the careers of primate artists, who would be the most logical next candidate besides human beings to ever do something like that.

Prehistoric images. And the act of imagemaking seemed culturally agnostic. All over the world, prehistoric humans were

If you think about it, imagemaking was an analogue process for the longest time. It was photography that brought light into the picture.

Of course, the end result was still something persistent, that you could hold in your hand, that you could come back to year after year, even if the photo has yellowed and

The digital age is one of light and electronic signals. Perhaps it may be more apt to say light created by electronic signals. 

I've gone on and one about images and painting and printing and photography, but really today's story is about this little fella.

Meet Pixel. No, not the Google phone, not that pixel. This pixel has been around far longer than that phone. Pixel is a pretty well-defined character, multiple definitions, in fact.
