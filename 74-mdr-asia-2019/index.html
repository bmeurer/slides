    <title>Making CSS from good to great: the power of Subgrid</title>
    <meta name="description" content="Even though Grid allowed us to do many things with an ease that was not possible before, there is still room for improvement. Cue Subgrid. This feature allows nested grids to participate in the sizing of their parent grids, solving a major pain point developers faced with just Grid alone. This talk will explain how subgrid works and the use-cases it solves.">

              <p>So when the web started out, 👾 layout was non-existent. You could format your text with spaces, line breaks and indents, sure. But having a designed visual layout on your web page? Nope.</p>
              <p>The HTML2 specification which was released in 1994 introduced 👾 the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag and although its intended use was for tabular data, that didn't stop people from using it to build all sorts of cool and funky layouts. Sure, some of the techniques involved slicing up an image into multiple parts or whatever, but it worked. Sort of.</p>
              <p>Then CSS came along in 1996, and with it came 👾 floats. And developers learned a new way to layout elements on their page. But floats weren't easy to deal with. Columns were uneven heights, things got displaced and didn't line up, you had to clear stuff.</p>
              <p>And because it was so hard and unwieldy, 👾 some people decided to build out pre-written code, AKA a framework, and let everyone else apply these pre-written styles with classes. This approach was really popular and we hit an age where a lot of websites had very similar layouts.</p>

              <p>But CSS is an evolving technology. Yes, it started out in 1996 as a long monolithic document, and at the time, browser vendors treated the implementation of CSS a bit like how Malaysians treat traffic laws. We take them as suggestions rather than rules.</p>
              <p>The CSS Working Group was created in 1997 to tackle issues which were not addressed in the first version of CSS and they have been working on improving and evolving CSS ever since.</p>
              <p>By 2000, CSS had been broken up into modules to clarify the relationships between different parts of the specification, and make it easier to test, update and maintain the specification as a whole.</p>
              <p>The 2018 CSS Snapshot released in January this year now consists of 99 modules, many of which are being actively worked on.</p>

              <p>In CSS2, we had 4 layout modes that each worked better for different use-cases. We had block layout, which was meant for laying out boxes on the page. 👾 We had inline layout, meant for laying out text.</p>
              <p>👾 Then we had table layouts that worked best for laying out 2D data in a tabular format. 👾 And positioned layout, which was like an escape hatch, that let us position elements without regard to other elements on the page.</p>
              <p>But in 2009, 👾 the flex layout model was proposed, and it was the first layout model designed specifically for building dynamic layouts on the web. It introduced new and powerful methods for distributing space and aligning content in a way that better suited the dynamic nature of the web.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>I'll be using some terms related to Grid throughout this talk, so I'd like to clarify them here. Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical lines that form the basis of the grid structure, and can be referred to by their numerical index, which starts from 1.</p>
              <p>Each space between grid lines are known as grid tracks, which make up the rows and columns of the grid, and represent the spaces your items appear in.</p>
              <p>The grid cell is a single unit of the grid and is made up of 2 adjacent row lines and 2 adjacent column lines. By default, each grid item takes up 1 grid cell. A grid area is made up of multiple grid cells.</p>
              <p>The best part about Grid, is the ability to define grid gaps, which are the gutters between grid tracks. This feature has been expanded to flex layouts as well, and you can already use it in Firefox 63 onwards.</p>

            <aside class="notes">In 2017, Grid was rolled out very successfully, might I add. By the end of March, all the major browsers had shipped a stable implementation which worked the same way. And by October, even Samsung Internet and Edge (RIP) joined the party.</aside>

            <a href="devtools/grid.html">Live demo</a>
            <aside class="notes">I've always used Firefox Devtools ever since I first started using Grid. Because it provided features that made it much easier to debug Grid layouts, since Day 1. But Devtools can be more than just that. It can be a means for the browser to help us understand CSS better.</aside>

            <h2>Why we need subgrid?</h2>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>There are numerous use-cases where we want our nested grids to align up to the outermost grid, for example, if you had a grid of card-style layouts with varied internal content heights. And you wanted the headers and footers for cards in the same row to all line-up.</p>
              <p>There was no way to do that without subgrid because the grand-child elements don't know about the outermost grid.</p>
