            <blockquote>“Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”<br><small>—Gerrit Noordzij</small></blockquote>
            <aside class="notes">I've come across many definitions of typography over the years, and have personally settled on this one by Gerrit Noordzij, that “Typography is writing with prefabricated letters”. Letters are the building blocks of a writing system, regardless of language. And if you think about it, almost every writing system in the world today seems to be alphabetic.</aside>
          </section>

          <section data-background-image="img/directions.jpg">
            <aside class="notes">But Chinese is different. Chinese is currently the only logographic writing system left that is widely used by millions of people. Each Chinese character is composed within a uniform square, allowing Chinese to be read efficiently, regardless of whether it is set horizontally or vertically. And until proven otherwise, it seems that the Chinese language was an indigenous invention, developed separately from the Proto-Sinaitic scripts which were the origins of alphabetic languages.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>We can see how the nature of Western languages in Europe differ from the Eastern languages in Asia. The Phoenician alphabet is considered the origin of many alphabetic writing systems on which the Greek and later, Latin and Cyrillic alphabets were based on. For such languages, letters are combined to form all the different words you would use to communicate with another person.</p>
              <p>With Chinese characters, we have thousands upon thousands of unique glyphs that can express meaning on their own or be used in combination with other glyphs. This has a direct consequence on the structure of the languages themselves.</p>

            <aside class="notes">While we're on the subject of letters, those on ancient Greek stone inscriptions used to be sans-serif, but later stone cutters tended to spread out the ends of letters into serifs. In the Middle Ages, scribes and copyists based their writings off of these stone inscriptions. And the letter forms evolved because writing was done with pens instead of chisels. Various writing styles emerged, from Carolingian minuscules to the various Gothic hands, which in turn served as inspiration for type designers and punch cutters doing printing.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">Chinese characters also changed a lot since their origins. It's just that Chinese writing went through the entire process of development and evolution way earlier than Europe. The key implement of Chinese writing is the brush. Calligraphy was and still is one of the most highly regarded Chinese arts. Woodblock printing was invented in China, and the Chinese were exceptional at it. To the point where it was a contributing factor to why moveable type, which too was invented in China, never really took off there.</aside>

              <p>The contemporary typefaces used for Chinese print publications can be broadly classified into these families: 宋体 (also known as 明体), 楷体, 仿宋体, 黑体. Both 黑体 and 仿宋体 are twentieth century creations.</p>
              <p>It is not uncommon to see comparisons of 宋体 to serifs and 黑体 to sans-serifs, but I think it makes more sense for Chinese typefaces to maintain their own classifications. They are completely different from Latin alphabets anyway.</p>

            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Chinese typefaces are extremely challenging to create, simply due to the volume of glyphs required. Source Han Serif, which is the second Pan-CJK typeface family from Adobe Type, was officially announced in April this year. But work on this typeface started in late 2014. And they had quite a large team working on it. The average number of glyphs for a Chinese system font is around 35,000 glyphs, plus or minus a couple thousand.</p>
              <p>Typefaces that have enough glyph coverage to be used in body copy are usually made by foundries, like Founder Type or Monotype, as very few independent type designers have the bandwidth for that.</p>

              <p>宋体 is the standard font for body copy. 楷体 is used for runs of text that need to be differentiated from the rest of the content, like dialogues or references. 黑体 is most commonly seen in digital publishing but publishers have started to experiment with 黑体 in print as well. 仿宋体 is generally used in isolated paragraphs like quotations or highlighted sentences.</p>
              <p>There are actually a huge variety of other styles, like those based of ancient scripts and brush script styles, but they fall into the general category of decorative fonts, mostly used for display text or short paragraphs. Not so much for long form reading.</p>

              <p>A lot of articles on how to pick typefaces tell us that all typefaces have a personality, and we ought to pick typefaces based on the messaging we want to convey. I don't disagree. It's just that very few people delve into the why. Why do these letters have human traits? Research has suggested that a lot of it boils down to prior experience with the typefaces in particular contexts.</p>
              <p>For Latin-based typefaces, old style and transitional serifs like Caslon, Garamond and Baskerville are most often used in books and formal documents. People tend to associate these as being serious and formal.</p>

            <aside class="notes">To pair Chinese scripts with Latin scripts for body copy is reasonably straightforward, in that you want to pick styles that present an even typographic colour. In this regard, serifs go with 宋体 and sans-serifs go with 黑体. In general, you'd want their stroke thickness to match up, but keep in mind that Chinese glyphs appear denser than their Latin-based counterparts at the same size, so adjustments will need to be made for that.</aside>

              <p>We first need to understand the web as a medium, and to be fair, it is a rather young medium. But the web is nothing like we've seen before. It is a dynamic and interactive medium, and many designers, especially those who are used to having absolute control over the final presentation, find this disturbing.</p>
              <p>The thing is, with the web there is no longer a single final form of presentation, as multiple output devices could be used to view it.</p>
              <p>Authors can only influence the presentation, rather than control it. A combination of influences from various sources, like the browser and users themselves will determine how the final output looks like.</p>
              <p>Dependable delivery is also uncertain, as web resources are distributed across multiple connected servers and the possibility of any of them being unavailable is pretty significant.</p>
              <p>Although many would like to think the web is simply print expressed on an electronic screen, it is not. It is a unique medium on its own.</p>

              <p>Here's a list of common font formats used on the web. But why on earth do we need so many formats? Well, here's my non-technical explanation. Fonts are simply containers for glyphs, and font formats describe these glyphs. The earliest fonts were pixel-based bitmaps, which were fine for low-resolution screens, but for printing on high-resolution printers, we needed a better solution. Either compress the bitmapped glyphs, or find an alternative rendering method.</p>
              <p>Donald Knuth created Metafont in 1978 for the TeX system, which generated compressed bitmap fonts. John Warnock, founder of Adobe, came up with Postscript in 1985, which was the very first vector font.</p>
              <p>TrueType was Apple and Microsoft's answer to Adobe's font monopoly. Both companies then worked separately to improve TrueType, especially with regards to fonts for East Asian writing systems. And Apple came up with TrueType GX, later renamed Apple Advanced Typography, while Microsoft turned to Adobe and together they came up with OpenType.</p>
              <p>EOT, or embedded OpenType is Microsoft's proprietary standard, which is a compact form of OpenType fonts meant for use on web pages. Although they tried to submit this as a W3C recommendation, it was rejected in favour of WOFF, or the Web Open Font Format. WOFF was quite the industry effort, involving Microsoft, Mozilla and Opera.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Those of us who have worked on projects with self-hosted fonts would probably have used something called the <code>@font-face</code> rule, where we declare a list of different font formats, in the hopes our fonts will show up correctly in as many browsers as possible. The number of font formats we need to declare has decreased over the years and right now, you can pretty much get away with declaring just WOFF and WOFF2.</aside>

            <p>Not counting the font shorthand, there are six basic font properties. The last two were introduced in Fonts Level 3. I'll quickly run through the first four. <code>font-weight</code> is for indicating the stroke thickness of your font, and can take values from <code>100</code> to <code>900</code> or keywords, like <code>bolder</code> or <code>lighter</code>.</p>
            <p><code>font-stretch</code> is used to select fonts based on their widths, ranging from condensed to expanded. <code>font-style</code> allows for the selection of italic or oblique faces. Italics are cursive, but obliques are sloped versions of a regular face.</p>
            <p><code>font-size</code> indicates the desired height of the glyphs, and we can use absolute values like pixels and ems or relative values like percentages or viewport units, as well as keywords like <code>larger</code> or <code>smaller</code>.</p>
            <p><code>font-size-adjust</code> was put in to address legibility issues. Faces with low x-heights may sometimes be less legible, especially when they are triggered as fallback fonts. This property adjusts the font size of the fallback such that its x-height matches the first-choice font.</p>
            <p><code>font-synthesis</code> is also new, and was put in to address the issue of faux bolds and faux italics. Sometimes the true italic or heavier version of a font does not exist and the browser will try to mimic those styles, and the end result often does not look good. So now you can set this property to a value of <code>none</code>, to prevent the browser from doing that.</p>

            <h2>Using non-system fonts</h2>
            <p>The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows us to link to fonts, either locally or external, which are fetched and activated when needed.</p>
            <p>We can use multiple <code>@font-face</code> rules to construct font families.</p>
            <p>A rule consists of the <code>@font-face</code> keyword followed by a block of font descriptors.</p>
            <aside class="notes">The <code>@font-face</code> rule allows us to use fonts beyond those available on a given platform by linking to those font files, which could be locally available or from an external source. Each rule specifies the characteristics of a single font within a family. These fonts will only be loaded when required. Multiple <code>@font-face</code> rules can be used to build an entire font family. And it consists of the <code>@font-face</code> keyword plus a bunch of font descriptors. Font descriptors and CSS properties are not the same thing.</aside>

    font-feature-settings: normal | &lt;feature-tag-value&gt; # 
  }</code></pre>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>This is how an <code>@font-face</code> rule looks like. I don't think most people read through the CSS specification like they would a novel, so it's perfectly fine if this looks excessively complicated to you. Even though there's a whole lot of stuff in here, only the <code>font-family</code> descriptor and the <code>src</code> descriptor are mandatory.</p>
            <p>If either of them are absent, the entire rule is ignored. Now the <code>font-family</code> descriptor is simply a label that we reference in other CSS declarations. So even if you're using say, Frutiger, you could actually label it “Pelmeni” and it would still work.</p>
            <p>The <code>src</code> descriptor is comma-separated list of external references or locally-installed font face names. It is made up of the declaration of the font file's location, and an optional format hint. If the browser doesn't support a particular font format stated in that hint, the font file won't be loaded.</p>
            <p>The next 3 descriptors, for style, weight and stretch, are used to match styles to a particular typeface in later declarations. Again, they are descriptors, so technically you could assign a black typeface to a font-weight of 100 and proceed to confuse your team members who cannot figure out why setting a weight of 100 gives them this massively bold typeface. Please don't do that.</p>
            <p>Every Unicode character is represented by a unique code point. The <code>unicode-range</code> descriptor allows us to specify individual code points or a range of code points for characters we want displayed using a particular font face. We can make use of this to create custom font families with glyphs from different typefaces.</p>

              <p>Font feature properties were introduced in Fonts Level 3. Earlier, when I talked about all the different font formats, I mentioned that Apple and Microsoft worked to improve the original implementation of TrueType. OpenType and Apple Advanced Typography are what we term modern font technologies, and they can contain a lot more glyphs that previous font formats.</p>
              <p>So we can utilise a variety of typographic features like swashes, ligatures, old-style numerals and so on. The original <code>font-variant</code> property that could only be used to trigger small-caps was also expanded, a great deal. Because there are so many properties available, each with lots of values, I'm just going to do a general overview. Some of you may be wondering, what's the point of having all these typographic features?</p>
              <p>They are part and parcel of good typography, which is necessary to hold your reader's attention. The written word is a transference of speech, which is heard, into something visual, to be seen. Good speakers will vary their cadence, use gestures, emphasise certain words.</p>
              <p>Typographic features like small caps, correct use of italics and punctuation do the same for text. Other features like old style numerals and ligatures help maintain typographic colour, to make reading more comfortable.</p>
              <p>So these are the features you can turn on via CSS, but note that the font you are using must have these features to begin with. This lot up there, are the features most often mentioned at web typography talks.</p>

              <p>Few people talk about <code>font-variant-east-asian</code>. What this property does is allow for glyph substitution and positioning in East Asian text. For the benefit of the audience who can't read Han characters, it might seem like these languages share the same glyphs but actually, it depends. Han unification, involves assigning the same code point to different glyphs, and it has been quite a controversial issue.</p>
              <p>But essentially, the same code point can have variant glyphs depending on the language being used. Like, simplified Chinese glyphs versus traditional Chinese glyphs. Japanese glyphs have their own specification known as JIS or Japanese Industrial Standard, and they too have alternate glyphs for the same character. This property allows us to toggle these variant glyphs.</p>
              <p>Now the <code>font-language-override</code> property controls the rendering of language-specific glyphs in the typeface used. A commonly raised use case is the use of common ligatures, for the fi combination. The Turkish alphabet has both a dotted and dotless i, so the fi ligature shouldn't be used. Maybe a typeface doesn't recognise a lesser-known language like the Azeri language, which, similar to Turkish, has a dotless i, the <code>font-language-override</code> property can be used to force the usage of Turkish glyphs instead.</p>
              <p><code>font-feature-settings</code> allows us to toggle very specific OpenType properties. Last I checked, there were 141 OpenType feature tags to cover things like vertical kerning, unicase, scientific inferiors and so on.</p>
              <p>Browser support for each of these individual properties varies at the moment, with Firefox being the only browser that has supported all of them since version 34.0. <code>font-feature-settings</code>, on the other hand, has quite good support across most browsers. The specification recommends to utilise the respective <code>font-variant</code> properties over the <code>font-feature-settings</code> property, but until browser support becomes more robust, I guess we'll continue to see this property being used instead.</p>

              <p>But at the end of the day, we still need to keep in mind that CJK fonts weigh in on a megabyte scale. The font hosting services do offer optimisations like lazy loading and dynamic subsetting, so hopefully that helps. If you want to serve your own fonts, there are also tools available to help reduce the size of your font files.</p>
              <p>If I'm building a non-Chinese site, I always turn to Font Squirrel to generate my webfonts, because subsetting. Font Squirrel's web font generator allows for a very granular level of customisation that I haven't found in other tools. There is a desktop application for Mac called FontPrep, which does subsetting quite well too.</p>
              <p>Font Spider is an open-source command line tool that does smart webfont compression and conversion. It offers the ability to subset fonts based on the glyphs being used on your site. Interestingly, it seems they all like to use animals for branding.</p>
              <p>But if you're really concerned about speed and page weight, you can simply choose not to use any webfonts at all, because honestly, I think that system fonts shipped with the newer OSes are getting much better.</p>
              <p>I personally use a hybrid technique, where the body text is set in a system font, but for the big titles and display text, where there is a limited number of characters I know will not change much over time, I generate webfonts containing only those glyphs, which makes the font file much much smaller than the full character set.</p>

              <p>This is a quote by Bruce Lee that I feel is really suitable for the web. Rather than trying to wrangle every pixel into place, we need embrace the fact that content is meant to flow.

              <p>Responsive websites are often mentioned in the same breath as media queries, the conditional rule that allows us to create different layouts at different screen widths. Often, people use frameworks to help them build responsive websites, and I can understand why. Especially if they are not familiar with CSS, or they are short of time, or they just don't like CSS in general. But frameworks quite prescriptive, and that's how we end up with a lot of websites that utilise very similar layouts.</p>
              <p>CSS layout has become so much more mature since it first began. There had never been a specification that was created specially for layout until Flexbox and Grid came along. And that is fantastic. We have a lot of CSS properties at our disposal now. Around 496 the last time I checked. And it is up to us to combine and implement them creatively.</p>

            <h2>The magic of Writing Modes</h2>
            <p>CSS Writing Modes Level 3 defines CSS features to support for various international writing modes, such as left-to-right (e.g. Latin or Indic), right-to-left (e.g. Hebrew or Arabic), bidirectional (e.g. mixed Latin and Arabic) and vertical (e.g. Asian scripts).</p>
            <aside class="notes">
              <p>Late last year, I had a thought while riding home on my bicycle after work. I wondered how hard it would be to typeset Chinese text on the web like the novels and comic books I used to read when I was a kid. And that's how I discovered a CSS property called <code>writing-mode</code>.</p>
              <p>There is an entire specification dedicated to writing modes and it's defined as such, support for international writing systems. So coverage includes right-to-left languages as well, but the <code>writing-mode</code> property specifically addresses vertical writing.</p>

            <aside class="notes">Let's cover some basic terminology. First up, inline base direction, which is that blue arrow there. It is the direction that content is ordered on a line, and defines where the line starts and ends. The green arrow indicates block flow direction, which is the direction block-level boxes stack and the direction of this stacking within their container. The <code>writing-mode</code> property dictates the block flow direction. What you see here is the standard default value of horizontal-tb.</aside>

              <p>This is when we apply <code>vertical-lr</code> and <code>vertical-rl</code> respectively. The block flow direction is now horizontal, while the inline base direction is vertical. And then there's the orientation of the individual glyphs.</p>
              <p>Every writing system has one or more native orientations. For example, Latin scripts and Arabic scripts are horizontal only, Mongolian is vertical only, and Han and Japanese Kana are bi-orientational. All glyphs are assigned a horizontal orientation by default, and the User Agent needs to transform text from this horizontal default when laying out text vertically.</p>

              <p>Because East Asian composition is quite different from Western composition, the W3C Japanese Layout Task Force has published a document known as the Requirements for Japanese Text Layout, which serves as a reference for browser implementers so Japanese web layouts can be rendered correctly. There is currently a Chinese equivalent being worked on right now.</p>
              <p>Based on those documents, and through my own personal experimentation, I sort of settled onto certain typographic conventions when I'm setting Chinese text.</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Use the appropriate font family. For example, Source Han Serif has typefaces for simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean. Pick the right one.</li>
                <li>This one I mentioned earlier, that Chinese characters are denser than typical Latin-based alphabets, because of all the strokes, so you may want to bump up the font size a little bit. Reading small characters on a screen is not a pleasant experience.</li>
                <li>For line-height there is actually a magic number. Ideally, setting it between 1.5 to 2 works fine so 1.7 is a good choice. This gives the text enough breathing room and a more even typographic colour.</li>
                <li>Every Chinese character takes up the same height and width, they are squares, even punctuation are full width characters. Using text-align: justify lines everything up neatly.</li>
                <li>Keeping lines to between 25 and 35 characters is something I picked up from print books. A lot of text-heavy books I find have lines with around 26 to 28 characters.</li>
                <li>For print books, the start of a new paragraph is indicated by a two character indent, but for the web, it looks better to have spacing between paragraphs, so just set a margin-bottom to distinguish different paragraphs of text.</li>

So here are some insights I gleaned from doing that.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">As I mentioned earlier, 25-35 characters per line is a reasonable length, and that's done by clamping the height of the content block. Because Chinese characters are squares, that also implies that in normal circumstances, a height of 25 ems gives you 25 characters per line. To vertically centre the content block, we can actually set the top and bottom margins to <code>auto</code>, something we wished we could do but couldn't for horizontal writing. But trying to centre things horizontally is equally painful, if not more, for vertical writing.</aside>

In 1926, the adventurous young artist stowed away on a ship bound for Argentina. While the ship was docked in Virginia, de Kooning slipped off, skirted immigration, and made his way to New Jersey—and so began the rest of his life.</p>

Properties like that use <code>block-start</code> and <code>block-end</code> or <code>inline-start</code> and <code>inline-end</code> instead of left and right. This specification is in the thick of working draft status but I'm eager to see it developed and implemented. For now, support is kind of limited.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">So for my experiment, I also put in a writing mode switcher to toggle between vertical and horizontal layouts, I guess because I felt like it. The tricky part for that was getting the images to display correctly. I would have loved to have a media query for writing modes so I could layout my images accordingly with the picture element, but that doesn't exist so I had to hack around it with transforms instead.</aside>

It's a website about Penang Hokkien, which is the dialect of my home town. And what I realised it that the ease of implementing vertical layouts opens up an aspect of graphic design that isn't often seen on the web at the moment.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">An idea I had was to make a bookshelf style list of posts with just CSS. So that was done using writing-mode and a rotation transform for the header, just to get the text to face the other direction. I have grown quite fond of using a vertical header when a page has many sections, I find it helps break up the monotony.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">But I'm also aware of the fact that for Latin-based languages, which is meant to be read horizontally from top to bottom, vertical text should largely be decorative. We don't want to compromise the reading experience for long form passages. So at smaller screens, we can make use of media queries to revert to a horizontal layout that makes better use of the limited space.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">Conversely, there are instances where vertical Latin text can work on narrow screen sizes as well. Perhaps you have realised that the hamburger menu is not the best mobile UI pattern we came with. You can layout your menu links vertically along the side edge of your site instead. And I'm sure many of you can come up with even more interesting designs that utilise vertical layouts.</aside>

            <aside class="notes">I also kept the switcher, which is actually a checkbox hack implementation. When I built this site, Grid hadn't landed yet, so I used Flexbox for a lot of the layout. Flexbox support is great, I mean, it has wider coverage than <code>border-radius</code>, but Flexbox with <code>writing-mode</code>? Not so good. I'll be honest, there are quite a large number of cross browser issues. Like, on Firefox, if you don't specify a width on the element with a vertical writing mode, it gets kicked off the page.</aside>

              <p>But that doesn't mean we should just shy away from using vertical text altogether. In fact, there's never been a better time than now to live on the cutting edge. Evergreen browsers are a thing now, with bug fixes and new features being shipped faster than ever. CSS Grid, I feel, is one of the best rollouts of a new major CSS feature ever, with almost all the major browsers shipping it in March this year. By now, more than 60% of the market is using a browser that supports Grid.</p>
              <p>And here's a little secret I discovered, by raising bugs we find when trying out new features, we are actually showing browser vendors that these features are in demand.</p>
              <p>This works both ways, if we don't use features simply because they are buggy, browser vendors will think that nobody really cares about that feature and choose to fix more pressing bugs instead. But if more of us use those features and raise the bugs we discover, it sends a signal to browser vendors that people are using these features and encourage them to address related bugs sooner than later.</p>

            <p>If you need inspiration for vertical layouts, the Tateyoko Web Awards site has really nice list. My friend, Jen Simmons, also has an experimental layout lab where she showcases all the different things that are now possible with modern CSS.</p>
            <p>And even if you don't end up using any of what I've covered immediately in your next project, I hope that you keep these techniques and properties in the back of your mind. And maybe one day, when you're tired of building the same old layouts again and again, you'll reach for them and create something amazing.</p>
