# Typesetting for a global web

*For YGLF Vilnius 2019. This is sort of a transcript of the talk.*

Labas rytas. I have this indescribable joy simply being here in Lithuania. Because long before all this web stuff happened, ever since I was 7 years old, Basketball was everything to me. So we're going to watch something.

The 2000 Sydney Olympics were broadcast live back then and trust me when I say I almost cried when Šarūnas Jasikevičius's last second 3-pointer came up short. When 2004 rolled around, Šarūnas didn't miss.

When team Lithuania walked off the court their heads held high, it felt as if they had won the gold already. So yes, Lithuania always had a special place in my heart. But I never imagined I would find myself here, after my basketball career was over, about to open a conference with a talk about web typography.

Web typography is a topic that has been covered quite extensively by numerous amazing speakers, so what I'd like to bring to the table today is some additional perspective about non-English typography as well. Hence the title of *Typesetting for a global web*.

My name is Hui Jing, you can also call me Jing. And these are the emojis that describe me. It is probably not obvious what the fox is for, but I use it to indicate that I'm a Mozilla Techspeaker, which is an initiative by Mozilla to support technical evangelists in regional communities around the world by providing resources and funding.

I also have a day job as a Developer Advocate with Nexmo. Nexmo being a platform that provides APIs for messenging, voice and authentication so developers can easily integrate communications into their applications.
