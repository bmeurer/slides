# Typesetting for a global web

*For YGLF Vilnius 2019. This is sort of a transcript of the talk.*

Labas rytas. Kaip sekasi? I hope everyone is having a great morning here at YGLF.

I have this indescribable joy simply being here in Lithuania. Because long before all this web stuff happened, ever since I was 7 years old, Basketball was everything to me. So we're going to watch something.

*play first clip*

The 2000 Sydney Olympics were broadcast live back then. I was 13 years old. That was the first time I saw the Lithuanian team play. I didn't know much about Lithuania before that Olympics, but as the tournament went on, it was obvious they were an excellent team.

That clip was from the semi-finals between Lithuania and the United States. And I think most people thought the Americans would cruise to the finals. Lithuania was down 12 points during half-time. But boy did they come out hot in the 2nd half and tied the game with 15.30 to go.

As the Lithuanians matched the Americans point for point, it seemed like the improbable could happen. That Lithuania would knock off the high and mighty Americans on one of the world's biggest stages.

My heart just sank when that last shot by Šarūnas Jasikevičius came up short. But Lithuanian basketball had left an impression on me for life.

When 2004 rolled around, Šarūnas didn't miss.

*play second clip*

As team Lithuania walked off the court their heads held high, it felt as if they had won the gold already. So yes, Lithuania always had a special place in my heart. But I never imagined I would find myself here in Vilnius, after my basketball career was over, about to open You Gotta Love Frontend with a talk about web typography.

Web typography is a topic that has been covered quite extensively by numerous amazing speakers, so what I'd like to bring to the table today is some additional perspective about non-English typography as well. Hence the title of *Typesetting for a global web*.

My name is Hui Jing, you can also call me Jing. And these are the emojis that describe me. It is probably not obvious what the fox is for, but I use it to indicate that I'm a Mozilla Techspeaker, which is an initiative by Mozilla to support technical evangelists in regional communities around the world by providing resources and funding.

I also have a day job as a Developer Advocate with Nexmo. Nexmo being a platform that provides APIs for messaging, voice and authentication so developers can easily integrate communications into their applications.
